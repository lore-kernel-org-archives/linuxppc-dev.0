Valid comment. This was considered while working the patch. I left it
for now, in case we need this flag in future. If we end up not having
to use it, I will clean it up in a future patch.

Even though cxlflash gets cleaned up via cxl_remove() shutdown
hook, today it is a dependency on the code external to our driver.
To protect us from future API changes that could possibly impact
cxlflash, we want to maintain a clean and reliable way to get
called in the shutdown path.
