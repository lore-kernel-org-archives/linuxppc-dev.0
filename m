We have seen this also.  (e.g.  req->nr_phys_segments was 3, but
blk_rq_map_sg() returned 4.)  I was suspicious of the patch:

bio: modify __bio_add_page() to accept pages that don't start a new segment

But we put some debugging code in and didn't hit it.  We haven't
found the problem yet, either, though.  We're still looking.

As Christoph said, it would seem to be a problem with the block layer
merging.

The API for this seems defective, in that blk_rq_map_sg() should
never be returning a value indicating that it overwrote past the
end of the supplied SG array and depend on the caller to check it.
(We could get data corruption on another I/O if it used adjacent
memory for a different SG list, for example.)
