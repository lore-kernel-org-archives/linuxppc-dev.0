It's a bug which you think the whole list is completed when an interrupt is=
 raised, there is a potential risk when an interrupt is raised by "Programm=
ed Error". The "ld_running" is a s/w concept, we should not depend on it to=
 judge the status of descriptors list.

I know you don't like this process, but it's a safe and common process. You=
 can refer to other dma drivers, like ioap-adma, mv-xor and ibm-ppc440x-adm=
a.
Said far point, usb also take this method to judge which descriptor is comp=
leted, I don't know which device can use a s/w list to free all descriptors=
, you can refer to the implement of dl_reverse_done_list().

If you find any problem in my patch, please point out, or you can give a li=
nk about the bug you mentioned many years ago.

Thanks.

Attached again,
The interrupt is only report the state of hardware, we cannot assume all de=
scriptors are finished when an interrupt is raised.

I hope we can discuss it based on my patch. If you think my patch will invo=
lve some issue, please point out. I'm willing to fix it.
Thanks.
