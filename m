I'd much rather fix this in generic code.  How funky are your limitations?
In fact when I did the 32-bit quirk (which will also be used by a Xiling
PCIe root port usable on a lot of architectures) I did initially consider
adding a bus_dma_mask or similar to struct device, but opted for the
most simple implementation for now.  I'd be happy to chanfe this.

Especially these days where busses and IP blocks are generally not tied
to a specific cpu instruction set I really believe that having any
more architecture code than absolutely required is a bad idea.

My plan for a few merge windows from now is that dma_mask and
coherent_mask are 100% in device control and dma_set_mask will never
fail.  It will be up to the dma ops to make sure things are addressible.
