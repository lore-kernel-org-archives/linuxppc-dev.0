Let me try to understand.

The normal call sequence is call; push %rbp; mov %rsp, %rbp.  So rbp
points to (prev rbp, prev rip) on the stack, and you can follow the
chain back.  Right now, on a user access page fault or similar, we
have rbp (probably) pointing to the interrupted frame, and the
interrupted rip isn't saved anywhere that a naive unwinder can find
it.  (It's in pt_regs, but the rbp chain skips right over that.)

We could change the entry code so that an interrupt / idtentry does:

push pt_regs
push kernel_entry
push %rbp
mov %rsp, %rbp
call handler
pop %rbp
addq $8, %rsp

or similar.  That would make it appear that the actual C handler was
caused by a dummy function "kernel_entry".  Now the unwinder would get
to kernel_entry, but it *still* wouldn't find its way to the calling
frame, which only solves part of the problem.  We could at least teach
the unwinder how kernel_entry works and let it decode pt_regs to
continue unwinding.  This would be nice, and I think it could work.

I think I like this, except that, if it used a separate section, it
could potentially be faster, as, for each actual entry type, the
offset from the C handler frame to pt_regs is a foregone conclusion.
But this is pretty simple and performance is already abysmal in most
handlers.

There's an added benefit to using a separate section, though: we could
also annotate the calls with what type of entry they were so the
unwinder could print it out nicely.

I could be convinced either way.

I was imagining something a little more strict: single-step
interesting parts of the kernel and make sure that each step unwinds
correctly.  That could detect missing frames and similar.
