Subject: Linux 2.4.17 bug, mmap of /dev/mem
Sender: owner-linuxppc-embedded@lists.linuxppc.org
List-Id: <linuxppc-embedded@lists.linuxppc.org>


I use mmap of /dev/mem to access some pci devices in a user space program.
It can be any memory at all however, such as local bus memory. If the
program below is compiled, and the executable repeatedly run, there is
corruption of the system eventually. All the program does is read a longword
then write it back. If the write is removed, there is no problem. The read
is irrelevant. What I suspect is happening is perhaps the write causes a
page fault, which causes interrupt processing, and in that processing some
global structures are accessed which should be protected by semaphores.
Frequently I was getting a kernel Oops in the kupdated thread,
always inside the function get_hash_table. That function has some spinlocks
which get #defined away (no CONFIG_SMP, only 1 cpu). If I enable CONFIG_SMP
I don't get the corruption problems, but the kernel will eventually freeze
and if I stop it with the debugger it is in one of the spinlock loops.

This problem doesn't exist in x86 as far as I can tell.

/dev/mem is handled by drivers/char/mem.c. There is a special case there
#elif defined(__powerpc__)
	prot |= _PAGE_NO_CACHE | _PAGE_GUARDED;
#elif defined(__mc68000__)


Here is a simple program to demonstrate this bug. Just run this program
repeatedly and stuff starts happening (bad stuff).

#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

#define ADDR 0xf2300000
#define SIZE 0x00001000
main()
{
void *where;
int fd;
int t;
volatile unsigned long *base;

	fd=open("/dev/mem",O_RDWR);
	if(fd<0) {printf("Failed to open\n");return;}

	where=mmap(0,SIZE,PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,MAP_SHARED,fd,ADDR);
	if(where==(void *)0xffffffff)
	{
		close(fd);
		printf("mmap failed\n");
		return -1;
	}

	base=(void *)where;

	t=base[0];
	base[0]=t;
	printf("%x,%x\n",where,t);
	munmap(where,SIZE);
	close(fd);
}

Any thoughts on this are welcome. I include my config file below.
This is running on a ppc 8260, linux version 2.4.17.

Thanks!
Dave
