OK. In some future patch please reorganize the remove function so,
that it follows the template described in Documentation/PCI/pci.txt :
	Disable the device from generating IRQs
	Release the IRQ (free_irq())
	Stop all DMA activity
	Release DMA buffers (both streaming and coherent)
	Unregister from other subsystems (e.g. scsi or netdev)
	Release MMIO/IOP resources
	Disable the device
