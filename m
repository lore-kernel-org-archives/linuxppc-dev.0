Okay. Sorry for that. I fixed it.

Then I am not finding a reason why we have sdhci_get_of_property function ?? .
 I added a generic names like broken-adma that everyone can reuse it.
I made mistake of not adding it in the binding.

For eg : broken-cd is not added by me but I can use it. So I added
something like broken-adma as it was not present.

Okay

The generic sdhc framework doesn't have this capabiltiy. It uses the
quirks to identify the broken DMA and ADMA modes even
if the controller is capable of.

For DMA and adma we need some 32 bit to 64 bit translation driver.
The existing arasan driver only support 32 bit.

No We are using 4.9a ARASAN SDHCI

Not sure
