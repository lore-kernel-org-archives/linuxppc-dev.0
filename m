That is basically the same as PCI - PCI has no write ACK, so all
writes are buffered by the PCI interconnect and complete in some
undefined temporal order when multiple end points are involved.

This does not seem very different from what happens in x86..

The statement is not about buffering, or temporal completion order, or
the order of acks returning to the CPU. It is about pure transaction
ordering inside the interconnect.

Can write BAR -> FOO pass write CPU -> FOO?
