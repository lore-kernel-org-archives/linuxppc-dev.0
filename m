Would the race involve two tasks trying to call klp_patch_task() for the
same task at the same time?  If so I don't think that would be a problem
since they would both write the same value for task->patch_state.

(Sorry if I'm being slow, I think I've managed to reach my quota of hard
thinking for the day and I don't exactly follow what the race would be.)
