Don't forget you'd also have to look up the function's pt_regs offset in
the table.

Well, I had been assuming the three extra pushes and one extra pop for
interrupts would be negligible, but I'm definitely no expert there.  Any
idea how I can measure it?

How would that solve the problem?  Would pt_regs be moved or copied to
the irq stack?

Yeah, probably.

Thanks, looking forward to seeing what you come up with.
