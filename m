Sorry for the silence, I'm pedaling as fast as I can, honest...

All this sounds good.

...but this sounds like just the opposite...?  

I've had this conversation with folks in a number of subsystems.
Everybody wants to keep their documentation together in one place - it's
easier for the developers after all.  But for the readers I think it's
objectively worse.  It perpetuates the mess that Documentation/ is, and
forces readers to go digging through all kinds of inappropriate material
in the hope of finding something that tells them what they need to know.

So I would *really* like to split the documentation by audience, as has
been done for a number of other kernel subsystems (and eventually all, I
hope).

I can go ahead and apply the RST conversion, that seems like a step in
the right direction regardless.  But I sure hope we don't really have to
keep it as an unorganized jumble of stuff...

Thanks,

jon
