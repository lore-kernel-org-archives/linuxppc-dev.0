Yes. That data is actually in the sense buffer, but since I'm also setting DID_ERROR,
scsi_decide_disposition isn't using it. I've got a patch to do just as you suggest,
to stop setting DID_ERROR when there is more detailed error data available, 
but it will need some additional testing before I submit, as it will impact much
more than just this case. 

To add to my analysis above, #9 should not be there... It looks like
jiffies_at_alloc would also be getting reinitialized in this case, resulting in
a perpetual retry, which is what I was seeing.

Thanks,

Brian
