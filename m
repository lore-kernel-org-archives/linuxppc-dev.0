IIRC, for MSI or unlocked MSI-X it should look and work pretty much 
exactly like regular VFIO, as everything can be mediated by the VMM and 
host kernel.

Locked MSI-X would be a pain right now as we cannot intercept the Realm 
programming the MSI-X cap with a doorbell address and EventID value 
decided by the ITS driver in the Realm guest, so we'd somehow have to 
sniff those values out of the VMM's vITS emulation then try to configure 
an equivalent NS LPI to match, or have a hook in the ITS driver that 
knows when it's in a Realm and do some RSI handshake to proxy-allocate 
NS MSI vectors on the host and pass the real values back into the Realm.

I'm still hoping we (both CCA and possibly Linux in general) can get 
away with just refusing to support Locked MSI-X without GICv5, as once 
we have proper Realm MSIs with direct injection then all the problems go 
away (or at least become much smaller RMM problems that remain invisible 
to the host - the one "big" problem being that the RMM has to 
begrudgingly implement an entire GIC driver since it now has its own 
whole GIC to look after).

If that's all anyone will ever want then it does allow some degree of 
hackery like mirroring the whole of Realm S2 in an equivalent NS IOMMUFD 
domain, then forcing IOMMU_DOMAIN_IDENTITY for unaccepted devices within 
the guest. However I was under the impression that folks want to make 
meaningful use of devices while still in their untrusted pre-acceptance 
state (but maybe still switch them later), so it seems almost inevitable 
that eventually someone says "actually, we would like S1 vSMMU for 
untrusted scatter-gather as well..."

Agreed, and I think with this series we should be pretty close now, at 
least for coherent devices with 64-bit DMA masks. And from the thread 
over at [1], it sounds like Hyper-V's VMbus is ready to go as 
potentially our first user independent of any other PCI/TSM dependencies.

Cheers,
Robin.
