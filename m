That seems barely easier than checking if it finds a function in
.entry that's marked on the stack, and the latter has no runtime cost.

Hmm.  I need to think about the interrupt stack case a bit.  Although
the actual top of the interrupt stack has a nearly fixed format, and I
have old patches to clean it up and make it actually be fixed.  I'll
try to dust those off and resend them soon.

I bet we'll always need to support CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER for some
embedded systems.

I'll play with this a bit.
