Right - all the mmap activity in the xfs_repair test is coming from
memory allocation through glibc - we don't use mmap() directly
anywhere in xfs_repair. FWIW, all the IO into these pages that are
allocated is being done via direct IO, if that makes any
difference...

This level of pte interactions is beyond my level of knowledge, so
I'm afraid at this point I'm not going to be much help other than to
test patches and report the result.

FWIW, here's the distribution of the hash table we are iterating
over. There are a lot of search misses, which means we are doing a
lot of pointer chasing, but the distribution is centred directly
around the goal of 8 entries per chain and there is no long tail:
