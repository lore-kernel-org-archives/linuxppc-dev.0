And IIRC ftrace handlers cannot sleep and are called with preemption 
disabled as of now. The code is a bit obscure, but see 
__ftrace_ops_list_func for example. This is "main" ftrace handler that 
calls all the registered ones in case FTRACE_OPS_FL_DYNAMIC is set (which 
is always true for handlers coming from modules) and CONFIG_PREEMPT is 
on. If it is off and there is only one handler registered for a function 
dynamic trampoline is used. See commit 12cce594fa8f ("ftrace/x86: Allow 
!CONFIG_PREEMPT dynamic ops to use allocated trampolines"). I think 
Steven had a plan to implement dynamic trampolines even for 
CONFIG_PREEMPT case but he still hasn't done it. It should use RCU_TASKS 
infrastructure.

The reason for all the mess is that ftrace needs to be sure that no task 
is in the handler when the handler/trampoline is freed.

So we should be safe for now even from this side.
