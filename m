This is the same with x86 no ?

32-bit x86 kmap_atomic_prot is the same as ours...

In fact I wonder why the preempt_disable() in there since it needs to
be protected against interrupt ?

Or is it that we never actually call kmap_atomic_* these days from
interrupt, and the atomic versions are just about dealing with
spinlocks ?

Cheers,
Ben.
