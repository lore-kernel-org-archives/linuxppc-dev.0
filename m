Ok.

If we keep the unusual *_timer() naming (rather than timer_*() as hrtimer
has), we could use one of

a) start_timer(struct timer_list *timer, unsigned long ms);
b) restart_timer(struct timer_list *timer, unsigned long ms);
c) mod_timer_ms(struct timer_list *timer, unsigned long ms);
    mod_timer_sec(struct timer_list *timer, unsigned long sec);

The first is slightly shorter but conflicts with three files that use
the same name for a local function name. The third one fits
well with the existing interfaces and provides both millisecond
and second versions, I'd probably go with that.

We could consider even passing a default interval as another
argument to prepare_timer(), and using that in add_timer(),
but that would in those cases that have a constant interval
(maybe about half of the users from) and would be a bit surprising
to readers that are only familiar with the existing interfaces.

One final option would be a larger-scale replacement of
the API by mirroring the hrtimer style where possible while
staying compatible with the existing calls, e.g. timer_prepare(),
timer_add_expires(), timer_start(), ...
