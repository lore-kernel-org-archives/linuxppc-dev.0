The migration of LPARs across Power systems affects many attributes
including that of the associativity of memory blocks and CPUs.  The
patches in this set execute when a system is coming up fresh upon a
migration target.  They are intended to,

* Recognize changes to the associativity of memory and CPUs recorded
  in internal data structures when compared to the latest copies in
  the device tree (e.g. ibm,dynamic-memory, ibm,dynamic-memory-v2,
  cpus),
* Recognize changes to the associativity mapping (e.g. ibm,
  associativity-lookup-arrays), locate all assigned memory blocks
  corresponding to each changed row, and readd all such blocks.
* Generate calls to other code layers to reset the data structures
  related to associativity of the CPUs and memory.
* Re-register the 'changed' entities into the target system.
  Re-registration of CPUs and memory blocks mostly entails acting as
  if they have been newly hot-added into the target system.

---
Changes in RFC:
  -- Rename pseries_update_drconf_cpu to pseries_update_cpu
  -- Simplify code to update CPU nodes during mobility checks.
     Remove functions to generate extra HP_ELOG messages in favor
     of direct function calls to dlpar_cpu_readd_by_index, or
     dlpar_memory_readd_by_index.
  -- Move check for "cpu" node type from pseries_update_cpu to
     pseries_smp_notifier in 'hotplug-cpu.c'
  -- Remove functions 'pseries_memory_readd_by_index' and
     'pseries_cpu_readd_by_index' as no longer needed outside of
     'mobility.c'.
  -- Update patch for recent checkin compatibility
  -- Resubmit as RFC pending further integration with LMB changes
