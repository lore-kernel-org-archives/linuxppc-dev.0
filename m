Right, but that _sec variant is just a wrapper around the _ms functionality.

Again, that's variants. What I wanted to avoid is that mod_ restart_ start_
whatever distinction. It's pointless.

Some of them certainly can be converted. Though I'm starting to worry about
massive hrtimer usage, which can really become a burden because the expiry
functions run from hard interrupt context. We already have this horrible
construct of hrtimer -> tasklet -> real function, which is used to get the
hrtimer expiry out into softirq context.

We have similar issue in RT, where we need to move out everything which is
not hard irq safe to softirq context. I'm working on a solution there which
is less ugly than what we have now in RT. It's moving non irq safe timers
onto a different time base, e.g. MONOTONIC_SOFT, which merily wakes the
softirq when the first queued timer expires and let that one sort out the
expiry of those timers. It's WIP and should be available soon.

Thanks,
