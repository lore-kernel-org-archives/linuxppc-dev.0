No, this is just what brought this craziness to my attention.

For example, byte- and short-sized circular buffers could not possibly
be safe either, when the head nears the tail.

Who has audited global storage and ensured that _every_ byte-sized write
doesn't happen to be adjacent to some other storage that may not happen
to be protected by the same (or any) lock?
