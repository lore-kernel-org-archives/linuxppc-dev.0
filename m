Ioctl threads that use scsi_execute() can run for an excessive amount
of time due to the fact that they have lengthy timeouts and retry logic
built in. Under normal operation this is not an issue. However, once EEH
enters the picture, a long execution time coupled with the possibility
that a timeout can trigger entry to the driver via registered reset
callbacks becomes a liability.

In particular, a deadlock can occur when an EEH event is encountered
while in running in scsi_execute(). As part of the recovery, the EEH
handler drains all currently running ioctls, waiting until they have
completed before proceeding with a reset. As the scsi_execute()'s are
situated on the ioctl path, the EEH handler will wait until they (and
the remainder of the ioctl handler they're associated with) have
completed. Normally this would not be much of an issue aside from the
longer recovery period. Unfortunately, the scsi_execute() triggers a
reset when it times out. The reset handler will see that the device is
already being reset and wait until that reset completed. This creates
a condition where the EEH handler becomes stuck, infinitely waiting for
the ioctl thread to complete.

To avoid this behavior, temporarily unmark the scsi_execute() threads
as an ioctl thread by releasing the ioctl read semaphore. This allows
the EEH handler to proceed with a recovery while the thread is still
running. Once the scsi_execute() returns, the ioctl read semaphore is
reacquired and the adapter state is rechecked in case it changed while
inside of scsi_execute(). The state check will wait if the adapter is
still being recovered or returns a failure if the recovery failed. In
the event that the adapter reset failed, the failure is simply returned
as the ioctl would be unable to continue.
