We always did :-) It predates my involvement and I think it predates
even Pauls. It's quite silly actually since the first powerpc machines
actually had ISA devices in them, but that's how it's been for ever. I
suppose we could change it but that would mean digging out some old
stuff to test.

It should have been ZONE_ISA_DMA :-)

Yeah so we sort-of enable the config option but only populate the zone
on platforms using swiotlb (freescale stuff). It's a bit messy at the
moment I must admit.

Cheers,
