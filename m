The PCI spec has very strong wording on ordering that covers this
case. Stalled bridges have to follow the ordering rules, and posted
writes cannot pass other posted writes.

Since in PCI all three transactions:
 CPU -> FOO
 CPU -> BAR
 BAR -> FOO

Must traverse a shared bus segment, they must be placed on that bus in
the above order, and the bridge(s) toward FOO must preserve this
order.

ARM's AXI has similar rules, I just can't recall the tiny details
right now :)

It is the best situation I can think of where order of completion to
different devices would matter to a generic Linux driver..

.. And there are patches circulating right now for NVMe that enable
exactly this kind of transfer, and rely on these kind of semantics, so
it is a relevant detail :)
