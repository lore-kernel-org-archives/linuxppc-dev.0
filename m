Ok, sounds good.

Backing up a bit, although I brought up cpu_hotplug_disable(), I think I
misunderstood the race you mentioned.  I actually don't think
cpu_hotplug_disable() is necessary.  What do you think about something
like the following:

In klp_start_transition:

	get_online_cpus();
	for_each_possible_cpu(cpu)
		set_tsk_thread_flag(idle_task(cpu), TIF_PATCH_PENDING);
	put_online_cpus();

In klp_try_complete_transition:

	get_online_cpus();
	for_each_possible_cpu(cpu) {
		task = idle_task(cpu);
		if (cpu_online(cpu)) {
			if (!klp_try_switch_task(task))
				complete = false;
		} else if (task->patch_state != klp_target_state) {
			/* offline CPU idle tasks can be switched immediately */
			clear_tsk_thread_flag(task, TIF_PATCH_PENDING);
			task->patch_state = klp_target_state;
		}
	}
	put_online_cpus();
