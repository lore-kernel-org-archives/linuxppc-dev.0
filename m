Yeah missed to sent in plain text mode.

Thanks Dong !!

Are you sure on this ?? If SDHCI host VDD is  1.8V then the cards are
also capable to operate at 1.8V ? Didn't understand what you mean by
IO voltage capability

The preset value resgister says that  SDR modes requires 1.8V and we
disable the modes based on capability or quirk.

Same for us but somehow 1.8v is broken in our version.  Yeah so those
host can still use 1.8V by not setting the quirk or not setting the
capability register.
