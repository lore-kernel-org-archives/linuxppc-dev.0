I checked the assembly for my complied output and it ends up with
a single std (store doubleword aka 64 bits) instruction with offset
192 decimal (0xc0) from the base register obtained from the structure.

An aligned doubleword store is atomic on 64 bit powerpc.

So I would really like more details if you are blaming 64 bit
powerpc of a non-atomic store.

That said, the patch will affect the code by adding barriers.
Specifically, while powerpc has a sync before doing the store as part
of writeq, wrapping in a spinlock adds a sync before releasing the lock
whenever a writeq (or writex x=b,w,d,q) was issued inside the lock.

(sync orders all reads and all writes to both memory and devices from
that cpu).

But looking further at the code, I see such things as:

drivers/scsi/mpt2sas/mpt2sas_base.c  line 2944

        mpt2sas_base_put_smid_default(ioc, smid);
        init_completion(&ioc->base_cmds.done);
        timeleft = wait_for_completion_timeout(&ioc->base_cmds.done,

where mpt2sas_base_put_smid_default is a routine that has a call to
_base_writeq.  This will initiate io to the adapter, then initialize
the completion, then hope that the timeout is long enough to let the io
complete and be marked done but short enough to not be a problem when
the timeout occurs because we initialized the compeltion after the irq
came in.

The code then looks at a status flag, but there is no indication how
the access to that field is serialized between the interrupt handler
and the submission routine.  It may mostly work due to barriers in
the primitives but I don't see any statement of rules.

Also, while I see a few wmb before writel in _base_interrupt, I don't
see any rmb, which I would expect between establishing a element is
valid and reading other fields in that element.

So I'd really like to hear more about what your symptoms were and how
you determined writeq on 64 bit powerpc was not atomic.
