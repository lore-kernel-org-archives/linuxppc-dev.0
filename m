Yes, false positives and extra ifdefs are so much better. :-P

Why not just ifdef the functions/macros, and leave the types alone?  If
you're worried about direct access to struct members, you could even
ifdef the members away while leaving the struct itself.  It is not
normal practice in Linux to need ifdefs around #includes.

Maybe not so easy (mpc85xx_smp_defconfig with NOTIFY stuff turned off so
that SRCU gets deselected):

Are you sure KVM is the only SRCU user so impacted?  It's also likely
that new such problems get introduced, because most people are going to
have SRCU enabled and thus not notice the breakage they're adding.

There's also at least one place that needs to be fixed, that currently
expects to get other headers indirectly via srcu.h:

/home/scott/fsl/git/linux/upstream/lib/assoc_array.c: In function 'assoc_array_apply_edit':
