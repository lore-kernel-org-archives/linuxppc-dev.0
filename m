That would work.  Would it make sense to do the same for the irq entries?

I'd be glad to review a patch.  It should be straightforward.

Only on x86_64.

True.

How so?

Currently, rbp in the entry code is meaningless.  I'm suggesting that,
when we do, for example, 'call \do_sym' in idtentry, we point rbp to
the pt_regs.  Currently it points to something stale (which the
dump_stack code might be relying on.  Hmm.)  But it's probably also
safe to assume that if you unwind to the 'call \do_sym', then pt_regs
is the next thing on the stack, so just doing the section thing would
work.

We should really re-add DWARF some day.
