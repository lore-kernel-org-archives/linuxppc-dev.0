I just don't find that very convincing :-)  If the performance impact is
negligible, we should ignore it.  We should instead be focusing on
finding the simplest solution.

Hm, I view it differently.  Sure the stack frame is a bit unusual, but
as far as unwinders go, it _is_ normal.  So even a stock unwinder can
show the user that a pt_regs() -- or interrupt_frame() or whatever we
call it -- function was called.  Just knowing that an interrupt occurred
could be useful information, even without the contents of RIP.

To be honest I'm not crazy about it.  The ANNOTATE_IRQSTACK_PTREGS_CALL
macro needs knowledge about the implementation of ENTER_IRQ_STACK and
how many pushes it does.  I think that makes the entry code more complex
and harder to understand than my patch.

Also the unwinders would need to be quite a bit more complex, and would
need to know more of the intimate details of the irq stack.  That's
probably a less important consideration than entry code complexity, but
it's still significant when you consider the fact that the kernel has
many unwinders, both in-kernel and out-of-kernel.
