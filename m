Hi everyone -

I'm having some trouble getting my root filesystem mounted via nfs on an
sbc8260.  I'm using Linux-2.4.15 and PPCBoot-1.1.2.  I have both
configured to use fcc2 for the ethernet but it looks like Linux can't
use the ether net or something.  In my server's log I see linux being
downloaded but there isn't even a request to mount the root file
system.  I've used this nfs server before with the same root filesystem
(the difference was that I was using a Mach kernel) so I am 99.44% sure
that the server is not the problem.

Any insight that people could give would be greatly appreciated.

thanks,
Andy
