Great!  I really want to sort out this area as soon as possible, and
introducing more arch specific code isn't really helping with that.  In
fact my whole drive to consolidate code is based on the fact that
I want to fix issues like this in one code base instead of 20 slightly
different ones.

FYI, this is the Xilinx/RISC-V use case for the 32-bit limit,
which I'll need to respin a bit based on linux-pci feedback:

Ok, I guess we need still need to keep the return value for that.
