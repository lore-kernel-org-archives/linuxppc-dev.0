Digging a little deeper, it appears that it would be non-trivial to
port this to ia64:

...
a000000000040720 A __kernel_syscall_via_break
a000000000040740 A __kernel_sigtramp
a000000000040a00 A __kernel_syscall_via_epc
a000000100000000 T ia64_ivt
a000000100000000 T __start_ivt_text
a000000100000000 T _stext
a000000100000000 T _text
...

The top three symbols are the absolute symbols that are explicitly
whitelisted by scripts/kallsyms.c, and they are too far from 0 and too
far from _text to be representable in 32 bits
