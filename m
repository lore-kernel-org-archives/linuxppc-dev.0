Not sure... I can see places where I might want to spawn an arbitrary
number of these without having to preallocate structures... and if I
allocate on the fly, then I need a way to free that structure when the
kthread is reaped which I don't think we have currently, do we ? (In
fact, I could use that for other things too now that I'm thinking of
it ... I might have a go at providing optional kthread destructors).
