Sorry about the crossposting.

I wrote on the Yellow Dog Linux list when somebody asked about software
RAID on YDL about my experiences with it:

to which Tim Seufert replied on the same list:

Perhaps the PPC Linux developers and the Linux RAID developers should
get together on this and make some decisions so as to make it happen.
