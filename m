We do have the ioctls check the state and wait for EEH to complete
or fail completely in the event that the device is terminating (see
ioctl_common()). The drain exists to create a wait point for ioctls that
have already passed the state check and are active. The CXL services
cannot be called during the recovery window (maybe this requirement
will go away in a future release?), thus the reason for this 'drain'.

To handle it I considered 3 options:

 - add state check wraps to all CXL service calls
 - create a "running ioctls" count that could be evaluated
 - wrap the ioctl in read semaphore and obtain write access to 'wait'

I started with the first option and it quickly made the code very nasty. =
I then
began implementing the second option and as I was writing the code to =
wrap
the ioctl with increment/decrement statements, the third option entered =
my
mind and seemed like a much cleaner solution. Therefore I went with that
approach and did not look back.

With regard to your example, you bring up a good point and we'll need to
do something about that. One thought that comes to mind would be for us
to drop the semaphore before making this type of call (I believe there =
are
only 2 places like this), reacquiring it when we return, and then =
checking
the state to make sure we're not in a reset situation.

That's a good point. I originally had a case where there was a need for =
this
but have since removed it. I can fix that in v3.
