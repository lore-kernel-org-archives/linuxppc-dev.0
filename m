Actually, I don't disagree with that.  PA used to share sb_iommu with
ia64 (it's the same chipset for the HP versions), but we can't now
because ia64 is chained and we're not and there's no way to say chained
for this platform but not for these other more legacy ones.  If you have
a proposal for this, I'd be interested, so I don't have to do an all or
nothing conversion, but the config option isn't it because our platform
configuration is runtime determined (we usually select every driver and
let the actual one be chosen at runtime from the config table).
