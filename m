I have missed that the two commands are called with preemption
disabled. So, I had the following crazy scenario in mind:


CPU0				CPU1

klp_enable_patch()

  klp_target_state = KLP_PATCHED;

  for_each_task()
     set TIF_PENDING_PATCH

				# task 123

				if (klp_patch_pending(current)
				  klp_patch_task(current)

                                    clear TIF_PENDING_PATCH

				    smp_rmb();

				    # switch to assembly of
				    # klp_patch_task()

				    mov klp_target_state, %r12

				    # interrupt and schedule
				    # another task


  klp_reverse_transition();

    klp_target_state = KLP_UNPATCHED;

    klt_try_to_complete_transition()

      task = 123;
      if (task->patch_state == klp_target_state;
         return 0;

    => task 123 is in target state and does
    not block conversion

  klp_complete_transition()


  # disable previous patch on the stack
  klp_disable_patch();

    klp_target_state = KLP_UNPATCHED;
  
  
				    # task 123 gets scheduled again
				    lea %r12, task->patch_state

				    => it happily stores an outdated
				    state


This is why the two functions should get called with preemption
disabled. We should document it at least. I imagine that we will
use them later also in another context and nobody will remember
this crazy scenario.

Well, even disabled preemption does not help. The process on
CPU1 might be also interrupted by an NMI and do some long
printk in it.

IMHO, the only safe approach is to call klp_patch_task()
only for "current" on a safe place. Then this race is harmless.
The switch happen on a safe place, so that it does not matter
into which state the process is switched.

By other words, the task state might be updated only

   + by the task itself on a safe place
   + by other task when the updated on is sleeping on a safe place

This should be well documented and the API should help to avoid
a misuse.
