Not sure about whether we have ever defined what happens to
writel_relaxed() on WC memory though: On ARM, we disallow
the compiler to combine writes, but the CPU still might.

It's also not entirely clear to me what we want writel() inside a
spinlock to mean: should the spinlock guarantee that two writel()
calls on different CPUs that are protected by spinlocks are
serialized by those locks, or not?
