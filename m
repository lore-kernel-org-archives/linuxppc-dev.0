Yeah, I like being not "close" to the NULL address, though the
definition of "close" has been various values like 64K (mmap_min_addr)
and 1M (x86 BIOS junk and new stack-gap size). 4MB is above even that,
so, I think we're fine there. It's what Windows has used, so it's
familiar and any new attack methodologies would at least be shared
across OSes and architectures, so we should "notice" any problem with
the value, and then we can adjust it if we need to.
