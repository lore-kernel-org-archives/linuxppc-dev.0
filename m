Yup, totally agree that this is not ideal. The idea here is to not
even compile the structure for tinification purposes. ifdefs for
headers are ugly, but given the current code structure, I was not able
to figure out any other way around it without major overhaul.

Well, it is the major one which I encountered until now. There might
be other problems lurking which I will gladly try to fix if and when
they are reported.

I will send a patch fixing this(need to use rcupdate.h here
explicitly). Thanks for reporting these!
