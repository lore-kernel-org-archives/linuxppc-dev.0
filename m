[Marri] I know, but this patch is not modification of previous patch.
It is complete brand new from scratch again. In that case isn't this
 will be first version ?

[Marri} I will include comments in the further versions of this patch.

[Marri] It is 440SPe specific. Definition is moved ppc440spe-adma.c

[Marri]. With name change it can be used With any SoC ADMA driver.

[Marri] Reason for some functions in lined is 1) They are small enough
To be in lined 2) If keep them in ppc440spe-adma.c I will have to make
them
Non static to avoid "Used but not defined warnings". With too many
functions
Non static might cause name space pollution in the kernel ?

[Marri] Build time separation is only for entirely different SoC DMA
engine.
For example 440spe and 460sx has engierely different DMA architecture.
Whereas 440spe and 460ex can be determined at run time.I am planning to do
the run time selection for similar SoCs. I discussed This with Yuri as
well.

[Marri] I explained this above.

[Marri] With Dan's suggestion first I am working on separating SoC
specific functions
To avoid too many  changes. Next step is to re-name the functions in the
Adma.c to common name line ppc4xx_xxx().

Marri
