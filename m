For entry from user space (e.g., syscalls), it's easy to detect because
there's always a pt_regs at the bottom of the stack.  So if the unwinder
reaches the stack address at (thread.sp0 - sizeof(pt_regs)), it knows
it's done.

But for nested entry (e.g. in-kernel irqs/exceptions like preemption and
page faults which don't have dedicated stacks), where the pt_regs is
stored somewhere in the middle of the stack instead of the bottom,
there's no reliable way to detect that.

I think the easiest way to make it work would be to modify the idtentry
macro to put all the idt entries in a dedicated section.  Then the
unwinder could easily detect any calls from that code.

NMI, MCE and interrupts aren't a problem because they have dedicated
stacks, which are easy to detect.  If the tasks' stack is on an
exception stack or an irq stack, we consider it unreliable.

And also, they don't sleep.  The stack of any running task (other than
current) is automatically considered unreliable anyway, since they could
be modifying it while we're reading it.

I think we should avoid doing something like that because it would break
gdb and all the other unwinders who don't know about it.
