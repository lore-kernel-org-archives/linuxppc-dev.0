In the short term it might be necessary.  But the restart code should
forcibly kill the task instead of returning an error back up to
userspace in this case.  Once the memory map of the process has been
altered, there is no point in allowing it to continue (and likely dump
a useless core).  Btw, this failure mode seems to apply when
cr_read_files() fails, too...

But in the long term, things need to be more robust (e.g. restart(2)
returns ENOEXEC without messing with current->mm).  I think it's worth
looking at how execve operates... if I understand correctly, it sets up
a new mm_struct disconnected from the current task and activates it at
the last moment.
