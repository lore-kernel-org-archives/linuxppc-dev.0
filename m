The original powerpc code this is based on didn't require it. It was an
explicit design decision and I remember insisting that Grant follows it,
but I haven't yet reviewed his last batch.

DT is orthogonal. You have "helpers" that use the DT to resolve the
domain of an interrupt source and do the mapping for you, but I made
sure that you call always still create domains and map interrupts using
explicit domain pointers & hw numbers.

(And I need them to deal with ancient broken device-tree's on some
platforms such as oldworld PowerMacs).
