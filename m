Maybe I'm coming around to liking this idea.

In an ideal world (DWARF support, high-quality unwinder, nice pretty
printer, etc), unwinding across a kernel exception would look like:

 - some_func
 - some_other_func
 - do_page_fault
 - page_fault

After page_fault, the next unwind step takes us to the faulting RIP
(faulting_func) and reports that all GPRs are known.  It should
probably learn this fact from DWARF if DWARF is available, instead of
directly decoding pt_regs, due to a few funny cases in which pt_regs
may be incomplete.  A nice pretty printer could now print all the
regs.

 - faulting_func
 - etc.

For this to work, we don't actually need the unwinder to explicitly
know where pt_regs is.

Food for thought, though: if user code does SYSENTER with TF set,
you'll end up with partial pt_regs.  There's nothing the kernel can do
about it.  DWARF will handle it without any fanfare, but I don't know
if it's going to cause trouble for you pre-DWARF.

I'm also not sure it makes sense to apply this before the unwinder
that can consume it is ready.  Maybe, if it would be consistent with
your plans, it would make sense to rewrite the unwinder first, then
apply this and teach live patching to use the new unwinder, and *then*
add DWARF support?

Why the +1?

I keep wanting this to be only two pushes and to fudge rbp to make it
work, but I don't see a good way.  But let's call it
CREATE_NESTED_ENTRY_FRAME or something, and let's rename pt_regs to
nested_frame or similar.

I think I'd rather open-code this everywhere.  It'll make it clearer
what's going on.

As discussed, let's get rid of this bit.

This will be less mysterious if you open-code the macros.  Also, I
think you have to, some return_from_SYSCALL_64 needs to be directly
after the actual call instruction.  (But if you get rid of the hunks
above, I think this goes away too, so this may be moot.)

If you end up making the unwinder smart enough to notice that rsp is
just below pt_regs, then this can go away.  It's harmless, though.

Does using a register like this actually save any code size?
Admittedly, it's a bit cleaner.

Why is this two bytes long?  Is there some reason it has to be more
than one byte?
