Hi Wen,

I have been arranged a job related memory hotplug on ARM architecture.
Maybe I know some new issues about memory hotplug on ARM architecture. I
just enabled it on ARM, and it works well in my Android tablet now.
However, I have not send out my patches. The real reason is that I don't
know how to do it. Maybe I need to read "Documentation/SubmittingPatches".

Hi Andrew,
This is my first time to send you a e-mail. I am so nervous about if I have
some mistakes or not.

Some peoples maybe think memory hotplug need to be supported by special
hardware. Maybe it means memory physical hotplug. Some times, we just need
to use memory logical hotplug, doesn't remove the memory in physical. It is
also usefully for power saving in my platform. Because I doesn't want
the offline memory is in *self-refresh* state.

Any comments are appreciated.

Thanks,
Jerry

&gt; Yes, if we apply this patchset, we can test hot-remove memory on kvm g=

&gt; But that patchset doesn&#39;t implement _PS3, so there is some restric=
