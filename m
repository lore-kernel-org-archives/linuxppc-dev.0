Will update the date to Feb 2017 and also the affected kernel version to
4.12.

Agreed.

Agreed.

I'll remove the above limitation.

I'm not sure how to improve the consistency model section.  It already
has at least some mentions of changed function semantics and locking
semantics.  I'll leave it alone for now, unless you have a specific
suggestion.

This is a minor whitespace fix -- remove a space before tab.  I figured
I'd go ahead and fix it since I'm already changing some of the
surrounding code.
