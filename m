Ok, thanks. On amiga filesystem, partitition types are in 32bit ints,
but can also be represented as 4 chars, so maybe `RAID` would be a good
type for that ? I will try patching the kernel, and adding support in
libparted for recognizing such partitions, and try it out.

Does it make sense to do Software Raid on two partititons of the same
disk, just for testing purpose ?

Ok, thanks.
