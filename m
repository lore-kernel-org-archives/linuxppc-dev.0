So you have an e-mail message from one of the authors of the code.
Andy Polyakov wrote most of the code but there are probably other
contributors who never gave explicit consent for using their code
outside of OpenSSL. The OpenSSL maintainers made it explicitly clear by
stamping the OpenSSL license incompatible with GPL2 on the file that
they are not OK with hosting development for Linux kernel code.

This Cryptograms project did not seem to get anywhere so there is no
source for the code other than the OpenSSL tree. Merging code from
OpenSSL into Linux does not look legally feasible.

Andy Polyakov is unresponsive in discussions concerning his awesome
licensing terms.

The MAINTAINERS file has
IBM Power VMX Cryptographic instructions
M:	Leonidas S. Barbosa <leosilva@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
M:	Paulo Flabiano Smorigo <pfsmorigo@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
L:	linux-crypto@vger.kernel.org
S:	Supported

So presumably the maintainers have access to necessary legal advice to
determine what steps are necessary to make this driver maintainable
legally.

I do not expect this will be resolved overnight. However, there is no
progress on this issue whatsoever so I suggest removal of the driver.

Thanks

Michal
