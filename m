Ok, thanks.

And I just confirmed with the Alpha cross-compiler that the fields are
not 'padded out' if volatile either.

Do any arches consider this an 'optimization'?  I ask because this kind of
accidental adjacency sharing may be common. Even RCU has a char field,
rcu_read_unlock_special, in the middle of the task_struct; luckily the
adjacent field is a list_head.

Besides updating the documentation, it may make sense to do something
arch-specific. Just bumping out storage on arches that don't need it
seems wasteful, as does generating bus locks on arches that don't need it.
Unfortunately, the code churn looks unavoidable.
