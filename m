Well, Documentation/memory-barriers.txt was intended as a guide for Linux
kernel hackers, and not for hardware architects.  The need for something
more precise has become clear over the past year or two, and I am working
on it with some heavy-duty memory-model folks.  But all previous memory
models have been for a specific CPU architecture, so doing one for the
intersection of several is offering up some complications.  I therefore
cannot yet provide a completion date.

That said, I still suggest use of SYNC_ACQUIRE for read_barrier_depends().

No worries, I will add one.  Please see the end of this message for an
initial patch.

Please understand that Documentation/memory-barriers.txt is a living
document:

v4.4: Two changes
v4.3: Three changes
v4.2: Six changes
v4.1: Three changes
v4.0: Two changes

It tends to change as we locate corner cases either in hardware or
in software use cases/APIs.

As noted in another email in this thread, I do not believe that
WRC+addr+addr needs to be prohibited.  Sounds like Will and I need to
get our story straight, though.

Will?

    documentation: Subsequent writes ordered by rcu_dereference()
    
    The current memory-barriers.txt does not address the possibility of
    a write to a dereferenced pointer.  This should be rare, but when it
    happens, we need that write -not- to be clobbered by the initialization.
    This commit therefore adds an example showing a data dependency ordering
    a later data-dependent write.

 [!] Note that this extremely counterintuitive situation arises most easily on

 even-numbered cache lines and the other bank processes odd-numbered cache
