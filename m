What happened to this series? I want to add shutdown support to my
platform and I need to write a register on the PMIC in one driver to
configure it for shutdown instead of restart and then write an MMIO
register to tell the PMIC to actually do the shutdown in another driver.
It seems that the notifier solves this case for me, albeit with the
slight complication that I need to order the two with some priority.

I'm also considering putting the PMIC configuration part into the reboot
notifier chain, because it only does things to change the configuration
and not actually any shutdown/restart itself. That removes any
requirement to get the priority of notifiers right. This series will
still be useful for the MMIO register that needs to be toggled though.
Right now I have to assign pm_power_off or hook the reboot notifier with
a different priority to make this work.
