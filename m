Linus cast doubt on it, then the maintainers started picking it apart.
At the end, trying not to use notifier callbacks made the code so
complicated that even I didn't understand it anymore. With no consensus
in sight, I abandoned it.

Problem is really that the notifier call chain would be perfect to solve
the problem, yet Linus didn't like priorities (which are essential),
and the power maintainers didn't like that a call chain is supposed
to execute _all_ callbacks, which would not be the case here. If I were
to start again, I would insist to use notifiers. However, I don't see
a chance to get that accepted, so I won't. Feel free to pick it up and
give it a try yourself.

Thanks,
Guenter
