Yes.

It would be nice if we could do better, though, and actually notice
the pt_regs and identify the entry.  For example, I'd love to see
"page fault, RIP=xyz" printed in the middle of a stack dump on a
crash.  Also, I think that just following rbp links will lose the
actual function that took the page fault (or whatever function
pt_regs->ip actually points to).

Excellent.

Have you looked at my vdso unwinding test at all?  If we could do
something similar for the kernel, IMO it would make testing much more
pleasant.
