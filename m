probe_kernel_address() should be usable here.

hm, is that needed for other reasons than "it will fault"?

otherwise we could walk the whole string with probe_kernel_address()
before we do anything with it.

That's slightly racy against vunmap and CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC and
stuff.  Fixable by *never* dereferencing that pointer except via
probe_kernel_address().

If this takes off we might want a register-your-printk-handler
interface.  Maybe.

We also jump through hoops to print things like sector_t and
resource_size_t.  They always need to be cast to `unsiged long long',
which generates additional stack space and text in some setups.

And then there's the perennial "need to cast u64 to unsigned long long
to print it".  If we were to do

	printk("%SL", (void *)some_u64);

then that's still bloody ugly, but it'll save a little text-n-stack.
