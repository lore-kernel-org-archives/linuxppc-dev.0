Thanks a lot.

I like it. It is long but it well describes the purpose.

Livepatch is using many state variables:

  + global:                klp_transition_patch, klp_target_state
  + per task specific:     TIF_PENDING_PATCH, patch_state
  + per each new function: transition, patched
  + per old function:      func_stack
  + per object:            patched, loaded
  + per patch:             enabled

The dependency between them and the workflow is important to
create a mental picture about the Livepatching. Good names
help with it.

Best Regards,
Petr
