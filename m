The original commit message also outlines that the authors collaborated
directly with Andy.

commit 5c380d623ed30b71a2441fb4f2e053a4e1a50794
Author: Leonidas S. Barbosa <leosilva@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

    crypto: vmx - Add support for VMS instructions by ASM

    OpenSSL implements optimized ASM algorithms which support
    VMX instructions on Power 8 CPU.

    These scripts generate an endian-agnostic ASM implementation
    in order to support both big and little-endian.
        - aesp8-ppc.pl: implements suport for AES instructions
        implemented by POWER8 processor.
        - ghashp8-ppc.pl: implements support for  GHASH for Power8.
        - ppc-xlate.pl:  ppc assembler distiller.

    These code has been adopted from OpenSSL project in collaboration
    with the original author (Andy Polyakov <appro@openssl.org>).
