Hello,


I'm trying to get powerpc to build without block device support
(CONFIG_BLOCK=3Dn). I'm getting the following errors:

  CC      arch/powerpc/kernel/setup_32.o
In file included from include/linux/blkdev.h:17,
                 from include/linux/ide.h:13,

I fixed the errors with a small patch in the powerpc code only and I'm
comfortable with that. The matter I wanted your input on is the warnings
from bsg.h coming from this are of the file:

	...
#ifdef __KERNEL__

#if defined(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_BSG)
struct bsg_class_device {
        struct class_device *class_dev;
        struct device *dev;
        int minor;
        struct request_queue *queue;
};

extern int bsg_register_queue(struct request_queue *, struct device *,
const char *);
extern void bsg_unregister_queue(struct request_queue *);
#else
static inline int bsg_register_queue(struct request_queue * rq, struct
device *dev, const char *name
)
{
        return 0;
}
static inline void bsg_unregister_queue(struct request_queue *rq)
{
}
#endif

#endif /* __KERNEL__ */
	...

I noticed that the '#else' branch was last updated by James (a4ee0df8)
in order to address some other warnings in scsi_sysfs.c, for example, in
the next piece of code:

	...
        error =3D bsg_register_queue(rq, &sdev->sdev_gendev, NULL);

        if (error)
                sdev_printk(KERN_INFO, sdev,
                            "Failed to register bsg queue, =
errno=3D%d\n",
error);

        /* we're treating error on bsg register as non-fatal, so pretend
         * nothing went wrong */
        error =3D 0;
	...

The quick fix to those warnings is to add a declaration of struct
request_queue in bsg.h something looking like this:

	...
#ifdef __KERNEL__

struct request_queue; <- This is the addition

#if defined(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_BSG)
struct bsg_class_device {
        struct class_device *class_dev;
	...

However, I was wondering if there isn't a cleaner way of doing it. For
example, from the comments in scsi_sysfs.c it looks like it would be
possible not to call bsg_register_queue() at all when
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_BSG=3Dn and get rid of the '#else' branch in bsg.h as I
don't think bsg_register_queue() and bsg_unregister_queue() should be
called when CONFIG_BLK_DEV_BSG=3Dn.

Which solution would you be more comfortable with?


Thanks,
Emil.
