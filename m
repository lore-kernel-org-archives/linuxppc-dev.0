I was going to tackle that next :-)

I was under the impression that mmiowb was specifically about ordering
writel's with a subsequent spin_unlock, without it, MMIOs from
different CPUs (within the same lock) would still arrive OO.

If that's indeed the case, I would suggest ia64 switches to a similar
per-cpu flag trick powerpc uses.
