I'm not even sure, whether we need absolute timer wheel timers at
all, because most use cases are relative to now.

But it's easy enough to provide them. All we need for that is something
like

	unsigned long time_msec;	

which gets incremented every tick by the appropriate amount of
milliseconds.

Having that would also allow to replace all the

       end = jiffies + msec_to_jiffies(xxx);

       while (time_before(jiffies, end))
       	     ....

constructs with a milliseconds based machinery. So we can remove all
*_to_jiffies() interfaces over time.

Thanks,

	tglx
