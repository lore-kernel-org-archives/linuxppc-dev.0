I'm not sure you are correct here. As I wrote below, the implementatoin
of writel() contains an *explicit" memory barrier which is completely
different to a barrier() instruction:

No, I'm asking about ARM.

Yes, I wrote that code :-) We keep track of writes and put an implicit
stronger barrier in unlock on ppc64 because drivers never get mmiowb
right.
