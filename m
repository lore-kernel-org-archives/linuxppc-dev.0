We are not able to assign the cpu ids to the right node before the CPU
is present, because firmware doesn't provide CPU mapping <-> node id
before that.

Memory is mapped to the node through its own firmware entry, so I don't
think cpu id change can affect memory affinity, and before we know the
node id of the CPU, the CPU is not present and thus it can't use memory.

Could you give some ideas, proposals?
As the firmware doesn't provide the information before the CPU is really
plugged, I really don't know how to manage this problem.

Thanks,
