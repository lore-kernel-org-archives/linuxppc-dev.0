I think it would be negligible, at least for interrupts, since
interrupts are already extremely expensive.  But I don't love adding
assembly code that makes them even slower.  The real thing I dislike
about this approach is that it's not a normal stack frame, so you need
code in the unwinder to unwind through it correctly, which makes me
think that you're not saving much complexity by adding the pushes.
But maybe I'm wrong.

Hmm.

Maybe the right way would be to unwind off the IRQ stack in two steps.
Step one would be to figure out that you're on the IRQ stack and pop
your way off it.  Step two would be to find pt_regs.

But that could be rather nasty to implement.  Maybe what we actually
want to do is this:

First, apply this thing:

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/luto/linux.git/commit/?h=x86/entry_ist&id=2231ec7e0bcc1a2bc94a17081511ab54cc6badd1

that gives us a common format for the IRQ stack.

Second, use my idea of making a table of offsets to pt_regs, so we'd
have, roughly:

ENTER_IRQ_STACK old_rsp=%r11
call __do_softirq
ANNOTATE_IRQSTACK_PTREGS_CALL offset=0
LEAVE_IRQ_STACK

the idea here is that offset=0 means that there is no offset beyond
that implied by ENTER_IRQ_STACK.  What actually gets written to the
table is offset 8, because ENTER_IRQ_STACK itself does one push.

So far, this has no runtime overhead at all.

Then, in the unwinder, the logic becomes:

If the return address is annotated in the ptregs entry table, look up
the offset.  If the offset is in bounds, then use it.  If the offset
is out of bounds and we're on the IRQ stack, then unwind the
ENTER_IRQ_STACK as well.

Does that seem reasonable?  I can try to implement it and see what it
looks like.
