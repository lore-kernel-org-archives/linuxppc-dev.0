You can use the Power ISA document to make sure for yourself.

I mean write this as simply

+	ret &= ~ICSWX_XERS0;

(without any "if").

Many instructions set the CR bit to XER[SO] -- store conditional, slbfee.,
and all "normal" dot insns and of course cmp[l][i].  Or, shorter: "everything"
does this.

Only if you care what the final value of bit 3 in the CR will be.  Even
in the unusual case where you want to look at all CR field bits at once
it is cheap to just mask out the bit (as you do).

> We can not do this in icswx since this instruction can be used by other coprocessors in future. But I am not comfortable clearing as we are not touching this XER in the driver or result of NX operation. So I am proposing this patch to fix this not proper NX behaviour - ignores CR bit. 

I really wouldn't call it "not proper", that makes it sound like there
is an implementation bug or design mistake.  Instead, you could say that
your switch statement looks at the values of bits 0, 1, and 2, so you
just mask those -- you do not care about the value of bit 3, so you mask
it out.

Something like

+	/* Mask out the bits we do not care about. */
+	ret &= ~ICSWX_XERS0;
