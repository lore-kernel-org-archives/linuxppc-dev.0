The issue here is that the user context needs to be bound to the device =
so that
in the event that device goes away, it doesn't completely go away until =
the user
context is done using it. Without it, it is possible to crash when the =
context is
being freed.

Essentially this is the same as incrementing the count when an open is =
performed
on the device. The device can be removed (and is hidden upon doing so) =
but is
not actually freed until the reference is resolved (close()).

Not while a user is present.
