applied (with the commit message below) to tip/x86/debug for v2.6.27 
merging, thanks Linus. Can i add your SOB too?

commit 4afd2534d6d4a77f4b7497c92f1ff7528d8f4eaa
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
Date:   Sat Jul 5 15:32:41 2008 -0700

    x86, 64-bit: standardize printk_address()
    
    Changes the symbol-in-module format from
    
    	:ext3:add_dirent_to_buf+0x6c/0x26c
    
    to
    
    	add_dirent_to_buf+0x6c/0x26c [ext3]
    
    the latter was the standard format anyway (it's what "sprint_symbol()"
    gives you), and traps_64.c was the odd man out.
    
    In fact, traps_32.c already uses the standard print_symbol() format, so
    it really was an issue of the 64-bit code being odd (and I assume that
    this also means that it cannot break the oops tracker, since it already
    had to be able to handle both formats).
    
    I also removed the KALLSYMS dependency, so if KALLSYMS isn't enabled it
    will now give the same hex format twice, but I doubt we really care
    (such stack traces are unreadable whether it shows up once or twice, and
    the simplicity is worth it).
    
    If people do just a few more conversions like this, then the 52 added
    lines in lib/vsnprintf.c are more than made up for by removed lines
    elsewhere (and more readable source code).
