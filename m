Ouch.  I agree that it seems safe but it's way too hard to reason about.
And then it gets worse if you try to think about what happens when
adding another reverse operation.

I think this last paragraph is important.  It would simplify things
greatly and ensure we won't have klp_update_patch_state() changing
things in the background.

Hm, maybe we'd need to call cpu_hotplug_disable() before switching the
offline idle tasks?

There are a few issues with that:

1) The idle task of a missing CPU doesn't *have* a stack, so it doesn't
   make much sense to try to check it.

2) We can't rely *only* on the stack check, because not all arches have
   it.  The other way to migrate idle tasks is from the idle loop switch
   point.  But if the task's CPU is down, its idle loop isn't running so
   it can't migrate.

   (Note this is currently a theoretical point: we currently don't allow
   such arches to use the consistency model anyway because there's no
   way for them to migrate kthreads.)

Sorry, for some reason I think I saw KLP_UNPATCHED in your example
instead of KLP_UNDEFINED.  I get it now.

I'd rather avoid that :-)
