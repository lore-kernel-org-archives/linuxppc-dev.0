I am also not very conversant with PaX. AFAIU, we can use the
following methods to print the shared object dependencies instead of
ldd:

1. One can load the binary directly with LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1.

So, instead of:

# /lib64/ld-2.24.so ./large-bss-test-app
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

One can do:
# LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 ./large-bss-test-app
        linux-vdso64.so.1 (0x00007fffa67a0000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007fffa6590000)
        /lib64/ld64.so.2 (0x00007fffa67c0000)

2. There are other utils like pax-utils etc that we can use.

But, we generally cannot force a user to not use ldd to determine the
shared object dependencies, especially when all the documentation
points to it and it works well on the other archs like x86 and arm64.

Do you have any specific performance test(s) in mind which I can run
to see how the 1TB impacts them? I am trying to run ltp after this
change and will be able to share the results shortly, but I am not
sure it provides the right data to validate such a change.
