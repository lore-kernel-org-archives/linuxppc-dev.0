This is an issue as we don't have well defined semantics for WC.

At this point, I would suggest staying away from that (ie, not changing
them). We need to look into it.

I know for example that on powerpc I cannot give you any weaker
semantic on WC for writel (I have to put a full sync in there), but I
am trying to see if I can make writel_relaxed both work with the
existing semantics and provide combining. But it's not yet a given (our
weaker IO barrier, eieio, isn't architecturally defined to do anything
on G=0 space, looking with the HW guys at what the HW actually does).

Cheers,
Ben.
