But this cleanup is a huge performance regression. If it had been a few 
% why not, but here we are talking about 30% more time. And userspace is 
even worse, see below. I really doubt that porting the ASM 
implementation into userspace will make the regression disappear.

Lets give a summary on performance:

With the TALITOS security engine embedded on powerpc 885:

root@miae:~# time md5sum avion.au
6513851d6109d42477b20cd56bf57f28  avion.au
real    0m 0.71s
user    0m 0.00s
sys     0m 0.38s

With kernel PPC MD5:

root@miae:~# time md5sum avion.au
6513851d6109d42477b20cd56bf57f28  avion.au
real    0m 1.01s
user    0m 0.01s
sys     0m 1.00s

With kernel generic MD5:

root@miae:~# time md5sum avion.au
6513851d6109d42477b20cd56bf57f28  avion.au
real    0m 1.31s
user    0m 0.01s
sys     0m 1.30s

With userspace MD5:

root@miae:~# time ./busybox md5sum avion.au
6513851d6109d42477b20cd56bf57f28  avion.au
real    0m 2.38s
user    0m 1.99s
sys     0m 0.38s


Now, we are talking about MD5 which is obsolete and being replaced in 
our systems by SHA256. So a commit message ressembling to the one in 
commit 23e5c306a207 ("lib/crypto: sparc: Drop optimized MD5 code") would 
be better as a justification for the removal.

With the commit message modified to explain that MD5 is obsolete and 
using it is risky as you explained in the Sparc commit message, you can 
add Acked-by: Christophe Leroy (CS GROUP) <chleroy@kernel.org>

But please consider the above performance comparison when addressing the 
AF_ALG removal.

By the way, what are your plans for SHA1 ? I think SHA1 should likely go 
away as well for the same reason.

Christophe
