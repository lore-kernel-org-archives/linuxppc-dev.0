you'll need to repeat the removal of dependent headers. based on a quick
test here across gcc 4.5-6.2, if you remove rtl.h, tm_p.h, hard-reg-set.h
and emit-rtl.h in addition to tm.h, the plugins should build fine.

> And we get warnings without c-common.h: http://pastebin.com/Aw8CAj10

that's not due to c-common.h. gcc versions 4.5-4.6 are compiled as a C program
and gcc 4.7 can be compiled both as a C and a C++ program (IIRC, distros opted
for the latter, i forget what manually built versions default to but i guess you
went with the C compilation for your gcc anyway). couple that with -Wmissing-prototypes
and you get that warning regardless of c-common.h being included. something like
this should fix it:

for reference, this is the git commit that did the move:
