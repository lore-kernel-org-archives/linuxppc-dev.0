When you disable ints sooner (that is what term_afu does ?) you'll get no
more ints later isn't this what you want?

term_afu calls free_irq and this function
does not return until any executing interrupts for have completed.
This is the sync mechanism you need, it's lightweight
(does not add an additional check to your irq functions)
and closes the race window completely.
