Good. So I think this confirms our understanding so far.

So there are two cases to consider:

1.
	if (readl(DEVICE_DMA_STATUS) == DMA_DONE)
		mydata = *dma_bufp;



2.
	*dma_bufp = 42;
	readl(DEVICE_DMA_KICK_ON_READ);


For arm/arm64 we guarantee ordering for (1) but not for (2) -- you'd need to
add an mb() to make it work.

Do both of these work on power? If so, I guess I can make readl even more
expensive :/ Feels a bit like the tail wagging the dog, though.

Another thing I just realised is that we restrict the barriers we use in
readl/writel on arm64 so that they don't necessary apply to both loads and
stores. To be specific:

   writel is ordered against prior writes to memory, but not reads

   readl is ordered against subsequent reads of memory, but not writes (but
   note that in example (1) above, the control dependency ensures that).

If necessary, I could move the barrier in our readl implementation to be
before the read, then play the control-dependency + instruction-sync (ISB)
trick that you do on power.
