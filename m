I think there are two issues that cause the stack frame to explode
with KASAN, and
your patch addresses one but not the other:

1. checks for variables being accessed after they go out of scope.
This is solved by the
   union at the start of the function, as they never go out of scope now.

2. checks for array overflows when passing a local variable by
reference to another
   function that is not inlined.

To solve the second problem while keeping the in-kernel interface, the
approach that
David suggesteed would work, or you could have a wrapper around each function to
do the copy_from_user in a more obvious but verbose way as I had in my version.

With David's approach, you could actually replace the switch() with a
lookup table
as well.
