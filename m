This whole area needs a major refactoring - we currentl have three
different APIs to deal with addressability: dma_get_required_mask,
dma_capable/dma_set_mask and dma_capable from dma-direct.h, and there
is plenty of unexplainable mismatches between them.

Sorting this out has been on my TODO list, but I think it can only
effectively be done once the direct mapping implementations are
reasonably consolidated.

Sure.  Maybe I just need to steps 1 and 2 and let maintainers fill
in.

That looks way to sensible.  Which reminds me that I need to research
the history behind the low_totalram/high_totalram magic in
dma_get_required_mask.
