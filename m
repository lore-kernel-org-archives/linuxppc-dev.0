Yes. There's even another quirk, see further down ;-)

Maybe, but then readl is always horribly slow anyway so you may not
necessarily be losing that much.

That could be tricky... You may end up with something that reads before
triggering a DMA and ends up with the post-DMA value ... ugh.

Yeah so that other trick I'm talking about is also used for timing
accuracy.

For example, let's say I have a device with a reset bit and the spec
says the reset bit needs to be set for at least 10us.

This is wrong:

	writel(1, RESET_REG);
	usleep(10);
	writel(0, RESET_REG);

Because of write posting, the first write might arrive to the device
right before the second one.

The typical "fix" is to turn that into:

	writel(1, RESET_REG);
	readl(RESET_REG); /* Flush posted writes */
	usleep(10);
	writel(0, RESET_REG);

*However* the issue here, at least on power, is that the CPU can issue
that readl but doesn't necessarily wait for it to complete (ie, the
data to return), before proceeding to the usleep. Now a usleep contains
a bunch of loads and stores and is probably fine, but a udelay which
just loops on the timebase may not be.

Thus we may still violate the timing requirement.

What we did inside readl, with the twi;isync sequence (which basically
means, trap on return value with "trap never" as a condition, followed
by isync that ensures all excpetion conditions are resolved), is force
the CPU to "consume" the data from the read before moving on.

This effectively makes readl fully synchronous (we would probably avoid
that if we were to implement a readl_relaxed).

Cheers,
Ben.
