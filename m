A patch using this API is flying around, see
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/1476715742-14924-1-git-send-email-pmladek@suse.com
And I have one more, for hung_task.c, in the drawer.

I admit that I got sidetracked and did not push these conversions
last months. But the conversions are useful and I want to continue
or find a trainee that might continue.

I wanted to make your life easier, took inspiration from the
workqueues conversion and prepared the patch below. It is tested
with the above mentioned API user.

Please, let me known if you would prefer another approach.
I do not want to complicate development of the new timer API.
