So I really agree with everything you said here, but I do wonder why you haven't
sent a similar rant about the often 100+ patchsets for the -stable series.  We  
are supposed to review those and follow up on them to be sure they're suitable  
for a stable release.

Or the 100+ emails about regressions from version to version.  Etc, etc.

I'm not saying you're wrong, but it does seem a bit odd that you choose to reply
to this one, and not the other umpteen cases I often see.  Maybe it isn't about 
the size or volume of the emails, and more about the fact that it's 100 patches 
to implement _one_ thing?  If so, then I don't really think it's about list
traffic at all...
