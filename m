The whole thing seems very confused. It's not building for the target,
it's building for the host, ie. the Makefile sets hostprogs-m and
HOSTCFLAGS etc.

So it can't possibly work with cross compiling as it's currently
written.

Either the Makefile needs some serious work to properly support cross
compiling or it should just be disabled when cross compiling.

cheers
