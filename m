Hm.  I think we could fix all that in a more standard way.  Whenever a
new pt_regs frame gets saved on entry, we could also create a new stack
frame which points to a fake kernel_entry() function.  That would tell
the unwinder there's a pt_regs frame without otherwise breaking frame
pointers across the frame.

Then I guess we wouldn't need my other solution of putting the idt
entries in a special section.

How does that sound?

I found it, but I'm not sure what it would mean to do something similar
for the kernel.  Do you mean doing something like an NMI sampling-based
approach where we periodically do a random stack sanity check?

(If so, I do have something like that planned.)
