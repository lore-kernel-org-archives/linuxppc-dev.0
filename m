Hi Kees,

Thanks for the review.
Please see my comments inline.

I think you are right. Hmm, I think I was going by my particular use
case which might not be required for generic PPC platforms.

I have one doubt though - I have primarily worked on arm64 and x86
architectures and there I see there 64-bit user space applications
using the 64-bit load addresses/ranges. I am not sure why PPC64 is
different historically.
