Probably yes. It's one of those things where you try to deal with the
fact that 90% of driver writers barely understand the basic stuff and
so you need the "default" accessors to be hardened as much as possible.

We still need to get a reasonably definition of the semantics of the
relaxed ones vs. WC memory but let's get through that exercise first
and hopefully for the last time.

As long as you know the bus frequency...

:-)

The problem for me is not so much what I've seen, I realize that most
of the issues we are talking about are the kind that will hit once in a
thousand times or less.

But we *can* reason about them in a way that can effectively prevent
the problem completely and when your cluster has 10000 machine, 1/1000
starts becoming significant.

These days the vast majority of IO devices either are 99% DMA driven so
that a bit of overhead on MMIOs is irrelevant, or have one fast path
(low latency IB etc...) that needs some finer control, and the rest is
all setup which can be paranoid at will.

So I think we should aim for the "default" accessors most people use to
be as hadened as we can think of. I favor correctness over performance
in all cases. But then we also define a reasonable semantic for the
relaxed ones (well, we sort-of do have one, we might have to make it a
bit more precise in some areas) that allows the few MMIO fast path that
care to be optimized.

If you do that you should use the "s" version of the accessors. Those
will only do the above trick at the end of the access series. Also a
FIFO needs special care about endianness anyway, so you should use
those accessors regardless. (Hint: you never endian swap a FIFO even on
BE on a LE device, unless something's been wired very badly in HW).

I think what we have is fine, we just define that the standard
writel/readl as fairly simple and hardened, and we look at providing a
somewhat reasonable set of relaxed variants for optimizing fast path.
We pretty much already are there, we just need to be better at defining
the semantics.

And for the super high perf case, which thankfully is either seldom
(server high perf network stuff) or very arch specific (ARM SoC stuff),
then arch specific driver hacks will always remain the norm.

Ben.
