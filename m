We will start working on it as soon as  we  can  lay  fingers  on  an
arch/powerpc port for the 440SP/SPe...

Agreed, sorry.

Will fix. Thanks for pointing out.

Will check.

Will check.

Agreed.

You are right once more..

Thanks for poointing out

Agreed. Will rename.

...and change the file name.

Thanks for your valuable input. Will try to clean up.
