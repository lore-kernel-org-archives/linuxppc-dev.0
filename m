Hi Ben,

I don't seem to have the beginning of this thread, so please bounce it over
if you'd like me to look at it!

In context, this looks like a misunderstanding somewhere. barrier() is a
compiler barrier for us just like everybody else and we use the generic
implementation with the empty asm + memory clobber.

The reason we have it afterwards was for something like:

	while (!(readl(&status_register) & DMA_DONE))
		data = *dma_buffer

to ensure that we don't read stale data from the buffer. You might also
need this for systems with spurious/early IRQ delivery for DMA completion.

You'd have to throw in an explicit mb() if you wanted to order prior writel
before the side-effectcs of a a later readl.

No, it's ordered with respect to the release store to the lockword but
that doesn't mean that an unlock does anything like ensure that the read
has been satisifed (in particular, for your scenario above where it has
side-effects then unlocking the lock doesn't guarantee that they've
occurred).
