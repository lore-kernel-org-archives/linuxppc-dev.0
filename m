Could you describe the highlevel design of this feature in the cover
letter. I have tried to get some idea from the patchset but it was
really far from trivial. Patches are not very well split up (many
helpers are added without their users etc..).

This surprised me a lot but I couldn't find the respective code. Why do
you need to store anything in the pte? My understanding of PKEYs is that
the setup and teardown should be very cheap and so no page tables have
to updated. Or do I just misunderstand what you wrote here?
