When reposting a patch, please always indicate that this is new
version by using something like "[PATCH v2]" in the Subject line.

Also, please include here (i. e. below the "---" line, i. e. in the
comments section, a description of what was changed compared to the
previous version of this patch.

As is, you enforce us to rescan the whole patch again and check
manually if you have reacted to any of the comments sent before, and
how.  As is, you make reviewing your poatches harder than necessary.

Should such 440SPe specific code not be removed here and placed into
ppc440spe-adma.c instead?

Please do not add dead code - remove the whole "#if 0" block.

It seems youremove all code, but leave the (now empty) comment
headers? This makes little sense to me.

Again, all this is pretty low-level 440SPe specific code. Why do you
keep this in the common drive rfile instead of moving it into the new
440SPe specific file?

Formatting problems?

This is a header file, yet you add here literally thousands of lines of
code.


Note that more or less similar questions have been asked for the
previous version of this patch, but I fail to find any good
justification in your replies.


Selecting the architecture at build time is bad as it prevents using a
sinlge kernel image across a wide range of boards.  You only replied
"We select the architecture at build time." without any explanation if
there is a pressing technical reason to do it this way, or if this was
just a arbitrary decision.

The same goes for putting so much source code in a header file - I
really see no technical need for this (especially not if you build for
a single architecture only).

Also I wonder why you still keep so many 440SPe specific code in the
common file, even though you just create new 440SPe specific header
and source files.


Please elucidate.


Thanks.

Wolfgang Denk
