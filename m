What's wrong with autodetect?  Its saved my butt a number of times.

My recurring nightmare is involves a failed ide controller.  If the
failed controller is on the motherboard, then plugging in a store-bought
ide controller causes the BIOS to "randomly" renumber to hard drives.
(yes, sorry this is a PC issue, but I would guess that similar issues
lurk in open firmware, etc).

Thus, any sort of mounting that explictly references /dev/hdanything
is guarenteed to screw up (sometimes catastrophically) when trying
to recover from failed controllers (and sometimes even failed disks,
if you are trying to bootstrap your way through by temporarily putting
the replacement disk somewhere other than its permanent home).

And I'm a comp sci geek who wrote the original linux RAID HOWTO,
I pity the mere mortal sysadmin who has to go through this ...

So what's wrong with autodetect, again?
