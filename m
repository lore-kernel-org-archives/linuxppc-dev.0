Yes, I'm really sorry about that. I'm going through the main patch of the 
series (13/15) and it's slow to explore all details. I know Petr is in the 
process too (and I think he has found some issues. He'll speak up.).

That would be nice but I don't think it's realistic. The merge window is 
quite close and we still need to finish the review and get some Acks - 
at least arch maintainers and PeterZ and/or Ingo for rq lock.

It would be great to keep in next- for a while (one cycle) too.
