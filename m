A lot of those users could probably just ktime_get()/ktime_before() here,
as they would by definition not be performance critical.

I don't see a way to just tk->tkr_mono.base but with a ktime_get_coarse()
we could just return the ktime_t of the last tick and not even need a seqlock
on 64-bit architectures, or have to introduce a new API.
