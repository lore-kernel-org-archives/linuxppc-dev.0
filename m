No, it's not sufficient.

Replacing wmb() + writel() with wmb() + writel_relaxed() will work on
PPC, it will just not give you a benefit today.

The main problem is that the semantics of writel/writel_relaxed (and
read versions) aren't very well defined in Linux esp. when it comes
to different memory types (NC, WC, ...).

I've been wanting to implement the relaxed accessors for a while but
was battling with this to try to also better support WC, and due to
other commitments, this somewhat fell down the cracks.

Two options I can think of:

 - Just make the _relaxed variants use an eieio instead of a sync, this
will effectively lift the ordering guarantee vs. cachable storage (and
thus unlock) and might give a (small) performance improvement. However,
we still have the problem that on WC mappings, neither writel nor
writel_relaxed will effectively allow combining to happen (only raw
accesses will because on powerpc *all* barriers will break combining).

 - Make writel_relaxed() be a simple store without barriers, and
readl_relaxed() be "eieio, read, eieio", thus allowing write combining
to happen between successive writel_relaxed on WC space (no change on
normal NC space) while maintaining the ordering between relaxed reads
and writes. The flip side is a (slight) increased overhead of
readl_relaxed.

Cheers,
Ben.
