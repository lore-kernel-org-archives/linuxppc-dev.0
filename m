Alex is raising concerns on the netdev list.

"We are being told that if you use writel(), then you don't need a wmb() on
all architectures."

Alex:
"I'm not sure who told you that but that is incorrect, at least for
x86. If you attempt to use writel() without the wmb() we will have to
NAK the patches. We will accept the wmb() with writel_releaxed() since
that solves things for ARM."

> Jason is seeking behavior clarification for write combined buffers.

Alex:
"Don't bother. I can tell you right now that for x86 you have to have a
wmb() before the writel().

Based on the comment in
(https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-rdma/msg62666.html):
    Replacing wmb() + writel() with wmb() + writel_relaxed() will work on
    PPC, it will just not give you a benefit today.

I say the patch set stays. This gives benefit on ARM, and has no
effect on x86 and PowerPC. If you want to look at trying to optimize
things further on PowerPC and such then go for it in terms of trying
to implement the writel_relaxed(). Otherwise I say we call the ARM
goodness a win and don't get ourselves too wrapped up in trying to fix
this for all architectures."
