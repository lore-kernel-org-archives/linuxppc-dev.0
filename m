My point was more that we don't need to have something like it for ACPI,
since we don't get random drivers that need to be probed that way,
just one common implementation that calls into the PCI core. We should
of course share the common bits with pci_create_host_bridge() in some
form, but that can be done by moving the x86 pci_acpi_scan_root
function and/or acpi_pci_root_add() to a common place in drivers/pci
and then refactoring the internals.
