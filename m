This is not entirely true.  Certainly an initial-ram-disk is one
solution and is (I think) the preferred long-term solution. However
you can also boot from raid with kernel-parameters like:

   md=0,/dev/hda1,/dev/hdc1 boot=/dev/md0

where '0' indicated which md device (md0 in this case), and the
remaining words are the devices to assemble it from.

I personally think auto-detect is the wrong approach and have no
desire to extend it to other partition types (I cannot remove it from
DOS partitions as that breaks back-compatability).
Just use "md=..."
