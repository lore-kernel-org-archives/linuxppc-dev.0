Hi Russell,

We kindly pinged you several times asking for your state and for the
PR, but I suppose you were just too busy. Your PR were kind of
blocking patches for sdhci, if you remember.

Anyway, we did get some folks to test the patches and was thus fairly
confident that we could merge them. Chris asked me to try to collect
them in a PR for him, so I did. Sorry if I managed to screw some
things up, there were several conflicts and actual regressions, which
I tried to take care of.

The mmc people were also very helping in sending patches to fixup
related regressions, immediately after we merged your patchset. Thus
together I think we managed to pull it off.

Sure, we will adopt.

Please, feel free to send a patch to fixup my misstake. I will happily apply it.

Kind regards
