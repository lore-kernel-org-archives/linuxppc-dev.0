Yeah, that's a reasonable thing to do, and in fact I think there's code 
to do something similar when a task is switched out (this keeps user 
level drivers from having do mmiowb() type things).

FWIW, I think I had an earlier version of the patch that used the name 
pioflush() or something similar, the only confusing thing about that 
name is that the primitive doesn't actually force I/Os down to the 
device level, just to the closest bridge.

It'll be interesting to see if upcoming x86 designs share this problem 
(e.g. large HT or CSI topologies).
