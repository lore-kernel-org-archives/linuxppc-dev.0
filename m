This is nothing new or unexpected - it was last posted back in February,
and I elected that it should be held off until after the last merge
window.

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to post it immediately after the merge
window closed, partly because it needed to be rebased on top of tglx's
IRQ changes on which it depends.  I was carrying those as separate commits
to the ones Thomas was carrying in his tree - and in the event, Thomas had
modified his patches slightly between sending me copies of them and the
versions he sent during the merge window.
