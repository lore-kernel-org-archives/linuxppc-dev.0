Agreed.

For this driver, we don't actually seem to use the value returned from
the allocation function, only the virtual __iomem address we get after
calling qe_muram_addr(), so it would be a big improvement to just
store the virtual address as a pointer, and wrap the calls
to qe_muram_alloc/qe_muram_addr/qe_muram_free with an appropriate
helper that doesn't even show the offset.

However, I'd also separate the normal kmalloc pointer from the
muram_alloc() pointer because only the latter is __iomem, and
we shouldn't really call MMIO accessor functions on RAM in
portable code.
