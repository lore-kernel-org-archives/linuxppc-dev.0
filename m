How would task exit be observed?  Are all tasks in a restarted
container guaranteed to be children (in the sense that wait(2) would
work) of the initiating task?

Kernel memory allocation failure is not the kind of problem I'm trying
to address.  I am trying to address the case of restarting a checkpoint
image that needs features that are not present, where the set of
features used by the checkpoint image can be compared against the set
of features the platform provides.

I think I explained in my earlier mail why the current implementation's
cr_write_head_arch doesn't help in this case:

Again, how would 'cr' obtain exit status for these tasks, and how would
it distinguish failure from normal operation?
