We do an s390 allmodconfig for every linux-next release:

  http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/target/573/

And also for Linus' tree:

  http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/target/568/

We don't have alpha allmodconfig enabled, though we could, but we do build the
defconfig:

  http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/target/2499/
  http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/target/2494/

So I think that should be sufficient to catch any percpus that are introduced
in generic code with the same name as s390/alpha variables.

Yeah I guess it is. Thanks for merging the fix.

cheers
