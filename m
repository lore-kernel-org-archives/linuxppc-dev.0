It's one of the difference. Having a parent device can certainly make your
life simpler, since you have devm_kzalloc(), dev_info(), etc. Coming from
the other end, I think ACPI needs PCI to be available during early boot,
at a time where we might not want pci_create_host_bridge() to do the
right thing.
