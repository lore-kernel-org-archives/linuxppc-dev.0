It is for us, and will break any write combining.

This is a bug in the documentation.

Linus himself made it very clear years ago. readl and writel have to
order vs memory accesses.

So...

Historically, what happened is that we (we means whoever participated
in the discussion on the list with Linus calling the shots really)
decided that there was no sane way for drivers to understand a world
where readl/writel didn't fully order things vs. memory accesses (ie,
DMA).

So it should always be correct to do:

	- Write to some in-memory buffer
	- writel() to kick the DMA read of that buffer

without any extra barrier.

The spinlock situation however got murky. Mostly that came up because
on architecture (I forgot who, might have been ia64) has a hard time
providing that consistency without making writel insanely expensive.

Thus they created mmiowb whose main purpose was precisely to order
writel with a following spin_unlock.

I decided not to go down that path on power because getting all drivers
"fixed" to do the right thing was going to be a losing battle, and
instead added per-cpu tracking of writel in order to "escalate" to a
heavier barrier in spin_unlock itself when necessary.

Now, all this happened more than a decade ago and it's possible that
the understanding or expectations "shifted" over time...

Cheers,
Ben.
