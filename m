If the architecture is reordering writes to the peripheral, then removing
the compiler barrier can break the multi-arch drivers. barriers document
clearly states that device need to observe writes in order. 

Though for special cases like you mentioned, you can certainly do this:

wmb()
__raw_write/pointer access
__raw_write/pointer access
__raw_write/pointer access

/* flush everything */
mmiowb()
__raw_write/pointer access

There would be no ordering guarantee between the wmb() and mmiowb().
This can only be done for known code and known hardware. I don't believe
this applies to multi-arch drivers.
