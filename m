Yes, this is a lot of work to do.

Oh, I didn't mean it to be done before merging this patch set. Sorry for 
the confusion. The point was that as long as the performance is involved 
FP does not look that promising and DWARF could be better (but who knows, 
right?).

True. There should be a choice in this respect.
