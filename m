 Right, actually the ADMA devices we used (ppc440spe DMA engines) has=20
no limitations on the src_cnt (well, actually there is the limit - the=20
size of descriptors FIFO, but it's more than the number of drives=20
which may be handled with the current RAID-6 driver, i.e. > 256), but=20
I agree - the ASYNC_TX functions should not assume that any ADMA=20
device will have such a feature. So we'll implement this, and then=20
re-post the patches.

 OK.

 May I ask do you have in plans to finish and release your=20
implementation?

 Understood. Our goal was to be more close to the ASYNC_TX interfaces,=20
so we specified the destinations separately. Though I'm fine with your=20
prototype, since doubling the same address is no good, so, we'll=20
change this.=20

 Any comments regarding the drivers/md/raid5.c part ?
