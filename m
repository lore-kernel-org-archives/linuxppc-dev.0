Thanks for the clear explanation, this helps a lot.

I'm not sure about this solution.  When klp_complete_transition() is
called, we need all tasks to be patched, for good.  We don't want any of
them to randomly switch to the wrong state at some later time in the
middle of a future patch operation.  How would changing klp_patch_task()
to only use "current" prevent that?

I think we could fix it to be safe for future callers who might not have
preemption disabled with a couple of changes to klp_patch_task():
disabling preemption and testing/clearing the TIF_PATCH_PENDING flag
before changing the patch state:

  void klp_patch_task(struct task_struct *task)
  {
  	preempt_disable();
  
  	if (test_and_clear_tsk_thread_flag(task, TIF_PATCH_PENDING))
  		task->patch_state = READ_ONCE(klp_target_state);
  
  	preempt_enable();
  }

We would also need a synchronize_sched() after the patching is complete,
either at the end of klp_try_complete_transition() or in
klp_complete_transition().  That would make sure that all existing calls
to klp_patch_task() are done.
