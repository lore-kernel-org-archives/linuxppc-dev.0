Ok .  sorry for that ..

That's my point: a lot of the bugs are independent of the specific
host controller and could happen with any one of them. We want to
ensure that nobody tries to add another property with similar
semantics and a different name just because they are using a
different driver.

Then I am not finding a reason why we have sdhci_get_of_property function
?? .
 I added a generic names like broken-adma that everyone can reuse it.  I
made mistake of not adding it in the binding.

For eg : broken-cd is not added by me but I can use it. So I added
something like broken-adma as it was not present.

This is clearly not sdhci-specific, so make that a generic property
for all mmc.
okay.

But this does not describe the hardware properties. Don't add properties
that describe the lack of a kernel driver. If you can't do DMA yet,
use a dma-ranges property that lists one empty range to prevent
dma_set_mask() from working, so it will fall back to PIO mode. You
may have to fix the driver if that doesn't already work.

The generic sdhc framework doesn't have this capabiltiy. It uses the quirks
to identify the broken DMA and ADMA modes even
if the controller is capable of.

What kind of driver do you need here?
For DMA and adma we need some 32 bit to 64 bit translation driver.  The
existing arasan driver only support 32 bit.

Are you sure that you have version 8.9a of the Arasan SDHCI?
Yes
This sounds
like version specific quirks, so they are probably present in each
SoC that uses the same version.
Not sure.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any property you add needs to be documented in the DT b=
inding.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If possible, add generic properties for each bug you ha=
ve mmc.txt<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rather than the driver specific sdhci.txt, and implemen=
t the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I will add the binding in mmc.txt. I thought this was presen=
t but not.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parsing in a common function that is used for all mmc h=
osts.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As per mine understanding the sdhci_get_of_porperty is a com=
mon<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; parsing function=C2=A0 . Am I wrong ??<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
</span>A small side note: please fix your email client to use proper attrib=
ution<br>
of the citations. The way you reply, nobody knows what you are saying<br>
compare to what you quote. Also, reduce the quotation to the parts you<br>
are replying to.<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt; &gt; No, this is only used for sdhci, not for the other controllers.<b=
r>
&gt;<br>
&gt; But our&#39;s is a SHCI variant so I added it in this file.<br>
<br>
</span>That&#39;s my point: a lot of the bugs are independent of the specif=
ic<br>
host controller and could happen with any one of them. We want to<br>
ensure that nobody tries to add another property with similar<br>
semantics and a different name just because they are using a<br>
different driver.<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; An alternative would be to set all these bits based on the c=
ompatible<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; string of your host, if that is the only one that has all th=
ese bugs.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The host driver=C2=A0 (arasan) is reused but this quirks are need=
ed due to<br>
&gt; &gt; board issues. so I have a control over dtb only to fix this.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; What is the nature of the bug on that board? Is there a different<br>
&gt; way to describe that without introducing six new properties?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Sorry it is board and IP as well SoC errata&#39;s,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 1. Delay after power is required due to some voltage issues that will<=
br>
&gt; be fixed in next board revision<br>
<br>
</span>This is clearly not sdhci-specific, so make that a generic property<=
br>
for all mmc.<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt; 2. We need to support PIO mode as of now because DMA or ADMA requires<=
br>
&gt; some kind of translation driver that I am working on.<br>
<br>
</span>But this does not describe the hardware properties. Don&#39;t add pr=
operties<br>
that describe the lack of a kernel driver. If you can&#39;t do DMA yet,<br>
use a dma-ranges property that lists one empty range to prevent<br>
dma_set_mask() from working, so it will fall back to PIO mode. You<br>
may have to fix the driver if that doesn&#39;t already work.<br>
<br>
What kind of driver do you need here?<br>
<span class=3D""><br>
&gt; 3. The version of arasan variant we have in our SoC doesn&#39;t have t=
he<br>
&gt; HISPD=C2=A0 bit field in HI-SPEED SD card. So this makes HI-SPEED sdca=
rd<br>
&gt; work.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 4. NO_CMD23 is required for eMMC cards.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; These are not new properties.=C2=A0 Only the fact is I am using it for=
 our<br>
&gt; SoC from dtb. These quirks are already there in mmc common framework.<=
br>
&gt; Nothing is new.<br>
<br>
</span>Are you sure that you have version 8.9a of the Arasan SDHCI? This so=
unds<br>
like version specific quirks, so they are probably present in each<br>
SoC that uses the same version.<br>
