Apologies for hijacking this thread but I need to extend this discussion
somewhat regarding what a compiler might do with adjacent fields in a structure.

The tty subsystem defines a large aggregate structure, struct tty_struct.
Importantly, several different locks apply to different fields within that
structure; ie., a specific spinlock will be claimed before updating or accessing
certain fields while a different spinlock will be claimed before updating or
accessing certain _adjacent_ fields.

What is necessary and sufficient to prevent accidental false-sharing?
The patch below was flagged as insufficient on ia64, and possibly ARM.

Peter Hurley

Subject: [PATCH 21/26] tty: Convert tty_struct bitfield to bools

The stopped, hw_stopped, flow_stopped and packet bits are smp-unsafe
and interrupt-unsafe. For example,

CPU 0                         | CPU 1
                              |
tty->flow_stopped = 1         | tty->hw_stopped = 0

One of these updates will be corrupted, as the bitwise operation
on the bitfield is non-atomic.

Ensure each flag has a separate memory location, so concurrent
updates do not corrupt orthogonal states.
