That sentence needs changing - the MSRs don't allocate - for them gets
allocated.

This whole paragraph needs rewriting.

"to make it PAGE_SIZE"?

I know what it means but it reads strange and needs more restraint when
rewriting it. :)

 "Describe your changes in imperative mood, e.g. "make xyzzy do frotz"
  instead of "[This patch] makes xyzzy do frotz" or "[I] changed xyzzy
  to do frotz", as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change

Also, never say "This patch" in a commit message of a patch. It is
tautologically useless.

There's no DEFINE_PER_CPU_HV_SHAHRED. Typo.

No need for that comment.

What should you look into is why do you need to call the early versions:

" * producing a warning (of course, no warning does not mean code is
 * correct, so optimally document why the __ref is needed and why it's OK)."

And we do have the normal set_memory_decrypted() etc helpers so why
aren't we using those?

If you need to use the early ones too, then you probably need to
differentiate this in the callers by passing a "bool early", which calls
the proper flavor.

So this function gets called per-CPU but you need to do this ugly "once"
thing - i.e., global function called in a per-CPU context.

Why can't you do that mapping only on the current CPU and then
when that function is called on the next CPU, it will do the same thing
on that next CPU?

Yeah, no, you can't do that. That's adding this section unconditionally
on *every* arch. You need to do some ifdeffery like it is done at the
beginning of that file and have this only on the arch which supports SEV.
