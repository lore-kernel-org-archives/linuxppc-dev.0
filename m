Maybe it would be safe, though I'm not entirely convinced.  Regardless I
think we should avoid these situations entirely because they create
windows for future bugs and races.

Maybe you missed this paragraph from my last email:

| either at the end of klp_try_complete_transition() or in
| klp_complete_transition().  That would make sure that all existing calls

So a huge NMI delay wouldn't be a problem here.  The call to
synchronize_sched() in klp_complete_transition() would sleep until the
NMI handler returns and the critical section of klp_patch_task()
finishes.  So once a patch is complete, we know that it's really
complete.

I'm not sure how this would work.  How would the thread flag get set
again after it's been cleared?

Also I really don't like the idea of randomly updating a task's patch
state after the transition has been completed.

I don't think a mutex would work because at least the ftrace handler
(and maybe more) can't sleep.  Maybe a spinlock could work but I think
that would be overkill.
