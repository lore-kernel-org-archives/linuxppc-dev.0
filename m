Yeah, it just needs to match up new cpus to the cpu ids assigned to
the right node.

The node mapping for that cpu id changes *dynamically* while the
system is running and that can race with node-affinity sensitive
operations such as memory allocations.

Please take a step back and think through the problem again.  You
can't bandaid it this way.

Thanks.
