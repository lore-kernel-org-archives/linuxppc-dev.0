Not a problem, lots of devices are not connected to any "particular
standard busses".  All this means is that system devices are connected
to the "system" bus, nothing more.

Sorry, no, that doesn't mean they are special, nothing here is unique
for the point of view of the driver model from any other device or bus.

Wait, what "driver structure"?  If you need to initialize the driver
core earlier, then do so.  Or, even better, just wait until enough of
the system has come up and then go initialize all of the devices you
have found so far as part of your boot process.

None of the above things you have stated seem to have anything to do
with your proposed patch, so I don't understand why you have mentioned
them...

{sigh}

Removing and adding devices and handling hotplug operations is what the
driver core was written for, almost 10 years ago.  To somehow think that
your devices are "special" just because they don't use ACPI is odd,
because the driver core itself has nothing to do with ACPI.  Don't get
the current mix of x86 system code tied into ACPI confused with an
driver core issues here please.

That's fine, the driver core is independant from ACPI.  I don't care how
you do the scaning of your devices, but I do care about you creating new
driver core pieces that duplicate the existing functionality of what we
have today.

In short, I like Rafael's proposal better, and I fail to see how
anything you have stated here would matter in how this is implemented. :)
