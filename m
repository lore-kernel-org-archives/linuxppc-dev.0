But.. Sinan is right, you look anywhere in the driver tree and you
find stuff like this:

drivers/net/ethernet/intel/i40e/i40e_txrx.c

        /* Force memory writes to complete before letting h/w
         * know there are new descriptors to fetch.
         */
        wmb();


It is *systemic*

I even see patches adding wmb() based on actual observed memory
corruption during testing on Intel:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10177207/

So you think all of this is unnecessary and writel is totally strongly
ordered, even on multi-socket Intel?
