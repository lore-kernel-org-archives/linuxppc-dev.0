memcpy_toio is too expensive to actually use for anything performance
though. It is too pessimistic. What the drivers usually want is a
unwound block of 4 or 8 8-byte copies. No function calls, no
branching. Everything is already known to be aligned.

Most of the drivers have a unwound loop with writeq() or something to
do it.

But that was never a requirement of writel(),
Documentation/memory-barriers.txt gives an explicit example demanding
the wmb() before writel() for ordering system memory against writel.

I actually have no idea why ARM had that barrier, I always assumed it
was to give program ordering to the accesses and that _relaxed allowed
re-ordering (the usual meaning of relaxed)..

But the barrier document makes it pretty clear that the only
difference between the two is spinlock containment, and WillD wrote
this text, so I belive it is accurate for ARM.

Very confusing.

WC is usually the problem here.. I've been told it is necessary on ARM
as well..
