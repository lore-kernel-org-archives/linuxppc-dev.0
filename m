Wouldn't we still have the unlock ordering due to the io_sync hack or
are you thinking we should remove that too for the relaxed version?

Hmm, eieio is only architected to affect CI+G (and WT) so it shouldn't
affect combining
on non-guarded memory. Do most implementations apply it to all CI
accesses anyway?

Are there many drivers that actually do writeX() on WC space?
memory-barriers.txt
pretty much says that all bets are off and no ordering guarantees can be assumed
when using readX/writeX on prefetchable IO memory. It seems sketchy enough to
give me some pause, but maybe it works fine elsewhere.
