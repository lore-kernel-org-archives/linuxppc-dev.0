Ok, much better.

The common mmc_of_parse() handles "broken-cd", and the sdhci_get_of_property()
does so too. This is really a mistake we made earlier when it was added
to sdhi instead of the common code. We should remove the parsing for
that property from the sdhci driver and have the core handle it always,
but that require someone to do it and ensure that no subtle ABI changes
are introduced on the way.

For new properties, the right way is to add it to the common function only.

Ok, that sounds like a very simple case: The width of the DMA is determined
from DT by looking at the dma-ranges properties. If it doesn't work, one
of these steps that are supposed to happen are broken and you should
try to find out which one that is and fix it:

- The parent node of the sdhci device in DT must not claim to support
  64 bit if the bus is only 32-bit wide. A dma-ranges property containing
  "<0 0 1 0>" would describe a bus that has a 32-bit DMA address range that
  is 1:1 mapped to the root bus, which is the default.

- The ARM64 code must check that property in a call to dma_set_mask()
  or dma_set_mask_and_coherent(), and not allow a mask to be set that
  exceeds the size of the dma-ranges property.

- The sdhci driver must call dma_set_mask() or dma_set_mask_and_coherent()
  with the mask that is claimed by the device (usually 32 bit or 64 bit)
  and check the result.

- If the call to dma_set_mask() for the 64-bit mask fails, the driver must
  fall back to using the 32-bit mask and not attempt to use the 64-bit
  DMA registers.

This is the behavior we require anyway, and if this all works, you don't
need the extra quirks.

The above assumes that the limitation is enforced by the bus (e.g. an
AHB bus can only do 32-bit DMA). It would be a little different if you
have a 64-bit AXI bus and the Arasan device itself is limited to 32-bit
independent of the width of the bus it is connected to. Can you find out
which of these two cases you have?

Ok, then add a compatible string for this version to the arasan binding,
and set the quirks flags only for the 4.9a version and not for the 8.9a
version.
