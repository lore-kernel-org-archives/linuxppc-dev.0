My concern is that it changes the behavior. It will suddenly return
another information for addresses that were not dereference before.

But there was no dereference in kallsyms_lookup() before
and there is dereference now.

I mean that both kallsyms_lookup_size_offset() and kallsyms_lookup()
always returned the same @symbolsize and @offset before this patch.
But they might give different results now because kallsyms_lookup()
might be newly working with dereferenced value.

It is non-consistent, unexpected behavior and might cause problems.

You are changing the behavior of kallsyms_lookup() and introduce
a possible inconsistency in this patchset.

It might be innocent if kallsyms are used only to display
debug messages. But there are even functional dependencies,
for example kallsyms_lookup() is called in ftrace_match_record().

It would be more code but it should not be slower. The module lookup
is just hidden in the kallsyms call now.

Another solution would be to add another helper function into kallsyms
that does the dereference and keep the current one as is.

I think that the dereference might make sense even in the kallsyms
code. But we need to make sure that it is safe and consistent.
This complicates review of this patchset.
