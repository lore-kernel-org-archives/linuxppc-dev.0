No, this is only used for sdhci, not for the other controllers.

But our's is a SHCI variant so I added it in this file.

What is the nature of the bug on that board? Is there a different
way to describe that without introducing six new properties?

Sorry it is board and IP as well SoC errata's,

1. Delay after power is required due to some voltage issues that will
be fixed in next board revision

2. We need to support PIO mode as of now because DMA or ADMA requires
some kind of translation driver that I am working on.

3. The version of arasan variant we have in our SoC doesn't have the
HISPD  bit field in HI-SPEED SD card. So this makes HI-SPEED sdcard
work.

4. NO_CMD23 is required for eMMC cards.

These are not new properties.  Only the fact is I am using it for our
SoC from dtb. These quirks are already there in mmc common framework.
Nothing is new.
