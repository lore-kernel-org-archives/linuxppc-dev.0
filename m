I think it's a good idea, and it could work... BUT it would break
external unwinders like gdb for the in-kernel entry case.

For interrupts and exceptions in kernel mode, rbp *is* valid.  Sure, it
doesn't tell you the interrupted function, but it does tell you its
caller.  A generic frame pointer unwinder skips the interrupted
function, but at least it keeps going.  If we encoded rbp on entry, that
would break.
