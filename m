I also agree to remove the pcibios_add_bus() in arm which call .add_bus() to associate msi_chip
and PCI bus.

In my opinions, all PCI devices under the same PCI hostbridge must share same msi chip, right ?
So if we can associate msi chip and PCI hostbridge, every PCI device can find correct msi chip.
PCI hostbridge private attributes can be saved in PCI sysdata, and this data will be propagate to
PCI root bus and its child buses.

Breaking out the host bridge creation is a good idea, but there need a lot of changes, we can
do it in another series. And if we save msi chip in pci sysdata now, it will be easy to
move it to generic pci host bridge. We can also move the pci domain number and other common info to it.

Thanks!
