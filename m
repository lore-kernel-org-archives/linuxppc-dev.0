Hi Uma,

I do see a potential hang issue with this patch. See my comments below.

When this path is invoked, the current thread is consuming the last =
entry
available entry before the room must be read again. While the change
below is fine for circumstances where the hardware queue has room for
more than one command, consider a scenario where the queue has room
for only 1 command (the command that you just consumed via the atomic
but are not really consuming with a MMIO due to the revised goto).

In such a scenario this code would loop endlessly, bypassing the timeout
logic completely, until the read room reflected a value greater than 1.

If you instead fully consume the entry (goto write_ioarrin - similar as =
it was
before) and take into account the consumption when you update the cached
value (i.e.: cmpxchg(..., 0, room - 1) the scenario described above will =
not occur.
