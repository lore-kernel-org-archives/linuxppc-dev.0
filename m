Ok. For the interim, then, Sreekanth, would you consider a patch such as the one
below to allow mpt2sas to support 64 bit DMA on architectures that don't support
a 32 bit coherent mask and a 64 bit dma mask at the same time? Only compile tested
at this point. Will run it on a Power machine shortly to confirm it doesn't
break anything...

Commit 5fb1bf8aaa832e1e9ca3198de7bbecb8eff7db9c broke 64 bit DMA for mpt2sas on Power.
That commit changed the sequence for setting up the DMA and coherent DMA masks so
that during initialization the driver requests a 64 bit DMA mask and a 32 bit consistent
DMA mask, then later requests a 64 bit consistent DMA mask. The Power architecture does
not currently support this, which results in always falling back to a 32 bit DMA window,
which has a negative impact on performance. Tweak this algorithm slightly so that
if requesting a 32 bit consistent mask fails after we've successfully set a 64 bit
DMA mask, just try to get a 64 bit consistent mask. This should preserve existing
behavior on platforms that support mixed mask setting and restore previous functionality
to those that do not.
