Less flexibility, and it's IMO annoying to make the Xen case have
extra constraints.  It also makes it very awkward or impossible to
take advantage of the sti interrupt window, although admittedly that
doesn't work on Xen either, so maybe that's moot.

I'll try to take a closer look at #2 and see just how much I dislike
all the stack frame munging.  Also, in principle, it's only the
sleeping calls and the calls that make it into real (non-entry) kernel
code that really want to be unwindable through this mechanism.

FWIW, I don't care that much about preserving gdb's partial ability to
unwind through pt_regs, especially because gdb really ought to be able
to use DWARF, too.
