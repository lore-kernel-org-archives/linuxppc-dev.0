Hi Ira,

My comments inline.

Hi Ira and Dan,

Here is a introduction about my scenario of this case.

My case is use async_tx API to offload raid5,
Use fsl-talitos to compute parity calculation, fsl-dma to process memcpy.

What bug occurred to me?
Exception is thrown by BUG_ON(async_tx_ack_test(depend_tx)) in async_tx_sub=
mit().

What is the root cause of this bug?
The async_tx descriptor(depend_tx) is free'ed before async_tx_submit ack it=
.
That means async_tx descriptor should be acked before it's free'ed. In othe=
r
word, only ack'ed async_tx descriptor should be free'ed by dma engine.

How to fix it?
Add a queue ld_completed, move all completed descriptors in this queue, fre=
e
these descriptors at a proper time (these descriptors also should be acked)=
.

Dan, do you think my understand about "ack" is right? Thanks.=20

Thanks for your information. I will do more explanation of my idea in the
following answer.
Could you provide some sample code for reproduce bug, I don't know dmatest.=
c
whether is enough. I will add dma self test in fsldma.c.

Yes, no changes.

Yes, no changes.
I will add descriptions about all new interfaces.

Right, below is new implement of dma_do_tasklet();
First, dma_do_tasklet()
	-> fsldma_cleanup_descriptor()
		-> fsldma_clean_completed_descriptor(), free the descriptors which has be=
en ack'ed (I mean in queue ld_completed, not include other queues);
Second, transverse the queue ld_running
	-> fsldma_run_tx_complete_actions(), find the last descriptor which is com=
pleted, update the cookie to the highest number, run callback, unmap dma pa=
ges, and run dma_run_dependencies();
	-> fsldma_clean_running_descriptor(), move this descriptor from ld_running=
 to ld_completed.
Last,
	-> fsl_chan_xfer_ld_queue(), submit much more descriptors from ld_pending =
to ld_running.
I hope my description is clear enough.

Your description is clear, I agree with you, I will add fsldma self test in
the file.

Totally right. I think you understand my idea.

I hope you've already understand my issue:)
