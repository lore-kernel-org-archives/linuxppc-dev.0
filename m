Ok, I'll fix this in the next patch version.

Ok, it indeed looks much better. I think I should use 'ppc4xx' as driver
directory name now as we need to extend the driver to also support 460EX
later.

Yes, in the case 'len > PAGE_SIZE' this is true. I didn't look at
async_syndrome_val() code again before making this change and while
raid6 testing after this change I didn't notice any issues as passed
'len' was always equal to PAGE_SIZE. I must do this 'len' check while
looking for a suitable channel for pq_val operation so that there
will be a fallback to synchronous path in the case passed 'len' is
greater than PAGE_SIZE. I'll fix this.

ppc440spe-adma supports checking against the original parity values
asynchronously using following approach:
original parity values (as passed to async_syndrome_val()) are copied to
channels temporary p and/or q buffer(s). Then the generation of the
syndrome is performed using this temporary buffer(s) as destination(s).
When DMA engine generates p and/or q parity, it always performs XOR
operation with the destination p and/or q buffer(s) content while
writing to this buffer(s). In the case that the syndrome is valid,
the destination p and/or q buffer(s) will be cleared (set to zero)
after syndrome validation. This is checked by the subsequent DMA
DATACHECK operation which compares a buffer with a data pattern and
stores the comparison result in the Completion Status FIFO. We queue
a subsequent DMA DATACHECK descriptor for this check operation. The
temporary buffers can be immediately re-used, they do not store a
result a subsequent async_tx operation depends on. I think this is
still much better than doing the validation synchronously in software.

Anatolij
