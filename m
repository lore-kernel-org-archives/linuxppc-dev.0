A small side note: please fix your email client to use proper attribution
of the citations. The way you reply, nobody knows what you are saying
compare to what you quote. Also, reduce the quotation to the parts you
are replying to.

That's my point: a lot of the bugs are independent of the specific
host controller and could happen with any one of them. We want to
ensure that nobody tries to add another property with similar
semantics and a different name just because they are using a
different driver.

This is clearly not sdhci-specific, so make that a generic property
for all mmc.

But this does not describe the hardware properties. Don't add properties
that describe the lack of a kernel driver. If you can't do DMA yet,
use a dma-ranges property that lists one empty range to prevent
dma_set_mask() from working, so it will fall back to PIO mode. You
may have to fix the driver if that doesn't already work.

What kind of driver do you need here?

Are you sure that you have version 8.9a of the Arasan SDHCI? This sounds
like version specific quirks, so they are probably present in each
SoC that uses the same version.
