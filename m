From: Manoj Kumar <manoj@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

After a few iterations of resetting the card, either during EEH
recovery, or a host_reset the following is seen in the logs.
cxlflash 0008:00: cxlflash_queuecommand: could not get a free command

At every reset of the card, the commands that are outstanding are
being leaked.  No effort is being made to reap these commands.  A few
more resets later, the above error message floods the logs and the
card is rendered totally unusable as no free commands are available.

Iterated through the 'cmd' queue and printed out the 'free' counter
and found that on each reset certain commands were in-use and
stayed in-use through subsequent resets.

To resolve this issue, when the card is reset, reap all the commands
that are active/outstanding.
