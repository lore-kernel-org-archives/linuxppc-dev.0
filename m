I don't quite parse that, I think you mean PaX uses a different base for
an ELF interpreter vs a regular ET_DYN?

That would be cool. How do you know that it's an ELF interpreter you're
loading? Is it just something that's PIE but doesn't request an
interpreter?

Is the PaX code somewhere I can look at?

More or less. There are performance reasons why 1T could be good for us,
but I want to see some performance numbers to justify that change. And
it does mean you have a bit less address space to play with.

cheers
