That's a good idea, and I have considered it in the past.

However, it is easier to restarti a task in its own, new, context,
including the MM. For instance, you can leverage all memory syscalls.

An in-between way would be to switch to the new MM but not tear down
the original one, but rather save it along side. If a failure occur -
restore it.

Then, you'll have to ask the same question about all other resources -
signal handlers, open files, etc. Either you make all changes atomic
at once, or none - if you want the operation to be non-intrusive in
the case of an error.

However, I do think that this is not necessary: the tasks that are
doing the restart have been created from scratch for that purpose,
so they need not return any specific value to the user. It is the
task that initiates the restart that needs to handle error gracefully.
The scheme I proposed in the previous email does exactly that.

(This does not apply to self-restart, for obvious reasons, but that
is a special case anyway).
