Yes, you're right. I was just following the terminology that's already used
here, but actually that seems not be used anywhere else in the document!
I'll kill it.

Fair enough. I'd rather people used _relaxed by default, but I have to admit
that it will probably just result in them getting things wrong. Just a tiny
bit of wordsmithing brings this to:

 MMIO WRITE BARRIER


If you're happy with that, I'll send it as a proper patch.
