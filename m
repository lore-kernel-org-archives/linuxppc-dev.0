Yeah, I guess the "ditto" was intended to include the "unless we switch
them in klp_try_complete_transition() first" statement from the previous
comment.  I'll try to make it clearer.

Agreed, though I'd argue that these are rare edge cases which can
probably be refined later, outside the scope of this patch set.

This might only be a theoretical issue, as it only happens when patching
one of the idle functions themselves.

If we decided that this were a real world problem, we could use
something like schedule_on_each_cpu() to flush them out as you
suggested.  Or it could even be done from user space by briefly running
a CPU-intensive program on the affected CPUs.

To clarify I think this would only be an issue when trying to patch idle
code or schedule()/__schedule().

Yeah, that looks hairy...

Since this is such a specialized case (patching the scheduler in an idle
task while CPU-intensive tasks are running) this might also be more
reasonably accomplished from user space by briefly SIGSTOPing the CPU
hog.

Agreed, kudos to Petr :-)
