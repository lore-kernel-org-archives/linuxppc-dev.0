Ah, I see, I misunderstood your code.

See other email.  I think that, if you rework your series a bit to
have a generic version that works on all architectures, then do it
like you did on ARM, and make sure you leave the door open for the
inline patching approach, then it looks pretty good.

(None of this is to say that I disagree with Jason, though -- I'm not
entirely convinced that this makes sense for Zinc.  But maybe it can
be done in a way that makes everyone happy.)
