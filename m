So a problem that no one has ever complained about on _any_ arch is suddenly
a problem on a subset of Alpha cpus, but a problem I know exists on Alpha
isn't important because no one's filed a bug about it?

The only Alpha person in this discussion has come out clearly in favor
of dropping EV4/5 support.

The fact is that the kernel itself is much more parallel than it was
15 years ago, and that trend is going to continue. Paired with the fact
that the Alpha is the least-parallel-friendly arch, makes improving
parallelism and correctness even harder within kernel subsystems; harder
than it has to be and harder than it should be.

Linus has repeatedly stated that non-arch code should be as
arch-independent as possible, so I believe that working around problems
created by a cpu from 1995 _which no other arch exhibits_ is ludicrous.
Especially in generic kernel code.

That said, if the Alpha community wants to keep _actively_ supporting
the Alpha arch, fine. They could be working toward solutions for
making Alpha workarounds in generic kernel code unnecessary. If that means
compiler changes, ok. If that means arch-independent macros, well, they
can float that idea.

Or if they're comfortable with the status quo, also fine. By that, I mean
the Alpha arch gets no workarounds in generic kernel code, and if something
goes a little sideways only on Alpha, that's to be expected.

As Paul pointed out, a good first step would be for the Alpha community
to contribute byte and short versions of smp_load_acquire() and
smp_store_release() so that the rest of the kernel community can make
forward progress on more parallelism without Alpha-only limitations.
