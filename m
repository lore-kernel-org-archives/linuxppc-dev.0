By the way, Kees is working on landing these upstream as proper fixes
rather than the workarounds I did there. In most cases, it's a matter of
migrating from memcpy past the end of a constant string to strncpy (to
make sure that the destination is still fully filled but with zeroes
instead of arbitrary junk from rodata vs strcpy/strlcpy which won't
cover that). A few of them are a bit weirder though. I haven't seen any
false positives yet though, due to sticking to __builtin_object_size(p,
0) for now.

They probably need to be changed to use 'unsigned char foo[]' instead of
 'char foo' with &foo taken as an address and used as a larger buffer.
That's undefined and the compiler can assume it's limited to the size of
the type used to define it which then gets enforced by these fortified
wrappers rather than just used for optimization (in practice, it won't
break much without these, but it could).
