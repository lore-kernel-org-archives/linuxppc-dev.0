You are right that it is pity but it really should be safe because
it is not entirely random.

If the race happens and assign an outdated value, there are two
situations:

1. It is assigned when there is not transition in the progress.
   Then it is OK because it will be ignored by the ftrace handler.
   The right state will be set before the next transition starts.

2. It is assigned when some other transition is in progress.
   Then it is OK as long as the function is called from "current".
   The "wrong" state will be used consistently. It will switch
   to the right state on another safe state.

It reduces the race window a bit but it is still there. For example,
NMI still might add a huge delay between reading klp_target_state
and assigning task->patch state.

What about the following?

/*
 * This function might assign an outdated value if the transaction
`* is reverted and finalized in parallel. But it is safe. If the value
 * is assigned outside of a transaction, it is ignored and the next
 * transaction will set the right one. Or if it gets assigned
 * inside another transaction, it will repeat the cycle and
 * set the right state.
 */
void klp_update_current_patch_state()
{
	while (test_and_clear_tsk_thread_flag(current, TIF_PATCH_PENDING))
		current->patch_state = READ_ONCE(klp_target_state);
}

Note that the disabled preemption helped only partially,
so I think that it was not really needed.

Hmm, it means that the task->patch_state  might be either
KLP_PATCHED or KLP_UNPATCHED outside a transition. I wonder
if the tristate really brings some advantages.


Alternatively, we might synchronize the operation with klp_mutex.
The function is called in a slow path and in a safe context.
Well, it might cause contention on the lock when many CPUs are
trying to update their tasks.
