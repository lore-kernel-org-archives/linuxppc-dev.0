I agree, one of the above is good enough, if we do the large-scale API
replacement. Having both ms and sec variants would be for convenience
to avoid having lots of open-coded  '*MSEC_PER_SEC) multiplications.

We still need at least three variants of timer_init, for statically initialized
timers, dynamic allocation and on-stack allocation, as before.

For the 'abs' argument, I'd probably leave that out until we find code
that actually needs it and that can't use hrtimer as easily.

For timer_start_on(), that would be a replacement of add_timer_on(),
which only has seven callers today:

arch/x86/kernel/apic/x2apic_uv_x.c:             add_timer_on(timer, cpu);
drivers/tty/metag_da.c: add_timer_on(poll_timer, 0);
drivers/tty/mips_ejtag_fdc.c:
add_timer_on(&priv->poll_timer, dev->cpu);
drivers/tty/mips_ejtag_fdc.c:
add_timer_on(&priv->poll_timer, dev->cpu);
kernel/time/clocksource.c:      add_timer_on(&watchdog_timer, next_cpu);
kernel/time/clocksource.c:      add_timer_on(&watchdog_timer,
cpumask_first(cpu_online_mask));
kernel/workqueue.c:             add_timer_on(timer, cpu);

If hrtimer isn't already a better interface for those, we can probably
convert them all to the new API at once.
