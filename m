Of course. It was somewhat a given that it's ordered vs. any previous
MMIO actually, but it doesn't hurt to spell it out once more.

Right, for now I worry about UC semantics. Once we have nailed that, we
can look at WC, which is a lot more tricky as archs differs more
widely, but one thing at a time.

I have bad memories of old adaptec controllers ...

That said, I think the above might not be right on ARM if we want to
make it the rule, Will, what do you reckon ?
