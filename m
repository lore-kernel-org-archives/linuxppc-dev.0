Great that you a converting that driver! If there's a need for it, we
could always expose the sync/async need in blk_mq_start_hw_queues().
>From a quick look at the driver, it's using start queue very liberally.
Would probably make sense to see which ones of those are actually
needed. For resource management, we've got better interfaces on the
blk-mq side, for instance.

Since this is a conversion, might make sense to not modify
blk_mq_start_hw_queues() and simply provide an alternative
blk_mq_start_hw_queues_async(). That will keep the conversion straight
forward. Then the next step could be to fixup skd, and then we could
drop the _async() variant again, hopefully.
