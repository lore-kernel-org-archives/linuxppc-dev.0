You're right. They should be really rare and we can solve them (if we even 
want to) later.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes, that is true. I can imagine there are users who don't want to stop 
the cpu hog at all. Even for a fraction of time. HPC comes to mind. But it 
is not worth it to solve it with something like the code above. Let's add 
it to the very end of our TODO lists :).
