Agreed,

I always thought that the kernel should not interpret it at all. And indeed,
copy_siginfo_to_user() does

	if (from->si_code < 0)
		return __copy_to_user(to, from, sizeof(siginfo_t))

probably copy_siginfo_to_user32() should do something similar, at least
it should not truncate ->si_code it it is less than zero.

Not sure what signalfd_copyinfo() should do.

But perhaps I was wrong, I failed to find man sigqueueinfo, and man
sigqueue() documents that it passes sigval_t.

Yes, and probably ->ip should have been the part of siginfo too. Say,
if you get SIGBUS you can't trust sc->ip if another signal was dequeued
before SIGBUS, in this case sc->ip will point to the handler of that
another signal. That is why we have SYNCHRONOUS_MASK and it helps, but
still this doesn't look nice.

Oleg.
