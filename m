I think that's a great improvement, but I'm a bit worried about recommending
writel_relaxed() too much: I've seen a lot of drivers that just always use
writel_relaxed() over write(), and some of them get that wrong when they
don't understand the difference but end up using DMA without explicit
barriers anyway.

Also, having an architecture-independent driver use wmb()+writel_relaxed()
ends up being more expensive than just using write(). Not sure how to
best phrase it though.
