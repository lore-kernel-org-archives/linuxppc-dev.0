For ppc64_defconfig (which has CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y, i.e., it has a
dynamic relocation section containing a 24-byte RELA entry per
relocated quantity), I got the following numbers

101740 kallsyms entries
397 KB saved in permanent .rodata
2.4 MB saved in __init rela.dyn section
~500 KB saved in compressed image

For arm64, we don't have a compressed image, which is the reason I
need this for my arm64 implementation of CONFIG_RELOCATABLE (for
KASLR), since the RELA overhead goes straight into the distributed
image.

Thanks,
Ard.
