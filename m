Nice!

I have a few further thoughts, most of which have probably been
considered before:

This checks against address (void*)16, but I guess on most architectures the
lowest possible kernel address is much higher. While there may not be much
that to exploit if the expected kernel address points to userland, forbidding
any obviously incorrect address that is outside of the kernel may be easier.

Even on architectures like s390 that start the kernel memory at (void *)0x0,
the lowest address to which we may want to do a copy_to_user would be much
higher than (void*)0x16.

Should we explicitly forbid writing to rodata, or is it enough to
rely on page protection here?

accesses to .data/.rodata/.bss are probably not performance critical,
so we could go further here and check the kallsyms table to ensure
that we are not spanning multiple symbols here.

For stuff that is performance critical, should there be a way to
opt out of the checks, or do we assume it already uses functions
that avoid the checks? I looked at the file and network I/O path
briefly and they seem to use kmap_atomic() to get to the user pages
at least in some of the common cases (but I may well be missing
important ones).
