I'm a bit confused about how this is supposed to work, the TAINT_xxx
values are bit positions presently from 0 to 10, while BUGFLAG_xxx are
ranged from 0 up. You've set up BUGFLAG_TAINT() to that the TAINT_xxx
value is shifted up 8 bits but neglected the fact that the trap type is
16-bits on most (all?) of the platforms using trap-based BUG handling.

If the 'taint' in question is just the TAINT_xxx value by itself and will
never be a bitmap then that's fine, but there's certainly not enough room
to pass the bitmap in on top of the bugflag otherwise (I don't know if
this is your intention or not though).

Also note that some platforms (like SH) implement additional bugflags, so
we at least want to keep the lower byte available for architecture
private use.

Having said that, the current patch does work for me, although I'm a bit
nervous about someone thinking it's ok to pass in a taint bitmap here.
