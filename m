Ewan pointed out that blk_rq_check_limits()'s call to rq_mergable() was
introduced as part of Martin's DISCARD cleanup that prepared for
WRITE_SAME, see: commit e2a60da74 ("block: Clean up special command handling logic")

And prior to that, blk_rq_check_limits()'s (rq->cmd_flags & REQ_DISCARD)
check was introduced by some guy crazy doppelganger name "Ike Snitzer",
see commit: 3383977f ("block: update request stacking methods to support discards")

So basically we probably never needed the extra check in
blk_rq_check_limits() to begin with.. Ike was probably paranoid. ;)
