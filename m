No we don't need to handle 512TB, at least for now.

A process has to opt-in to using the address space above 128TB, and it
does that by calling mmap() with a hint above 128TB.

But by the time the process is running, and can call mmap(), we have
already finished calling arch_mmap_rnd() for that process. Once to
randomise where we load the executable if it's ET_DYN (in load_elf_binary()),
and the other to choose the mmap_base (arch_pick_mmap_layout()).

In future I suspect we might want to optionally use the full address
space for ASLR, and if/when that happens then we'll need to do something
differently.

Your v3 was OK, and I would have merged it except I knew it needed
reworking because of the 128TB address space change.

I was waiting for you to do a v4 based on the 128TB changes, but then
last night I saw your message asking which tree to base that on and so I
decided to quickly do it myself so as to not miss v4.12.

Sure. I know this has dragged on, it's one of those changes that seems
simple but isn't really. And then it collided with the 128TB changes
which made it more complicated again.

Sorry I didn't respond to your query on which tree to use, but I get a
lot of email and some days I just don't get through it all - or indeed
any of it :)

For a quick query like that you might be better asking on IRC, I and a
bunch of other folk who could have answered that question sit in #ppc64
on Freenode, feel free to join.


My next branch is here:
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/powerpc/linux.git/log/?h=next

And it's also included in linux-next.

In general you should just use Linus' master branch to base new work on.
But in this case you did need to use my next because the 128TB changes
are in there and this patch is dependent on them.

I don't think we handle them any differently. In this case I had this
patch already written, I sent some of it to you earlier remember, so it
wasn't actually based on your patch. But I'm happy to add your SOB,
and/or Ack/Tested by.

cheers
