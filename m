I like the description.

Just a note that we will also need to review the section about
limitations. But I am not sure that we want to do it in this patch.
It might open a long discussion on its own.

There are more checks possible. I would use the same description

I would put this mod_delayed_work() into klp_reverse_transition().
Also I would put that schedule_delayed_work() into
klp_try_complete_transition().

If I did not miss anything, it will allow to move the
klp_transition_work code to transition.c where it logically
belongs.

Why do you removed the WARN_ON_ONCE(), please?

We still add the function on the stack before registering
the ftrace handler. Also we unregister the ftrace handler
before removing the the last entry from the stack.

AFAIK, unregister_ftrace_function() calls rcu_synchronize()'
to make sure that no-one is inside the handler once finished.
Mirek knows more about it.

If this is not true, we have a problem. For example,
we call kfree(ops) after unregister_ftrace_function();

BTW: I thought that this change was really needed because of
klp_try_complete_transition(). But I think that the WARN
could and should stay after all. See below.

Please, add here some warning. Something like:

We allow to add/remove CPUs here. I am afraid that we will also need
to add a cpu coming/going handler that will set the task->patch_state
the right way. We must not set the klp_target_state until all ftrace
handlers are ready.

This is called also from klp_reverse_transition(). We should set it
only when the task need migration. Also we should clear it when
the task is in the right state already.

It is not only optimization. It actually solves a race between
klp_complete_transition() and klp_update_patch_state(), see below.

Also this stage need to be somehow handled by CPU coming/going
handlers.

We should call rcu_synchronize() here. Otherwise, there
might be a race, see below:

CPU1					CPU2

klp_ftrace_handler()
  if (unlikely(func->transition))
	// still true

					klp_complete_transition()
					  func->transition = false;
					  task->patch_state =
					      KLP_UNDEFINED;

     patch_state = current->patch_state;

     WARN_ON(patch_state == KLP_UNDEFINED);

BANG!: We print the warning.

Note that that smp_wmb() is enough in klp_init_transition()
but it is not enough here. We need to wait longer once
someone might be inside the if (true) code.

If TIF_PATCH_PENDING flag is set here it means that
klp_update_patch_state() might get triggered and it might
put wrong value into task->patch_state.

We must make sure that all task have this cleared before
calling this function. This is another reason why
klp_init_transition() should set the flag only when
transition is needed.

We should only check the state here.

It still might make sense to clear it when it is set wrongly.
But the question is if it is really safe to continue. I am
afraid that it is not. It would mean that the consistency
model is broken and we are in strange state.

We should not be here if anyone still might be in klp_update_patch_state().

This makes sense but it too me long time to understand. I wonder if
this might be better:

	/*
	 * Make sure that the function is removed from ops->func_stack
	 * before we clear func->transition. Otherwise the handler may
	 * pick the wrong version.
	 */

And I would call this only when the patch is being removed

	if (klp_target_state = KLP_UNPATCHED)
		synchronize_rcu();

I think that this was the reason to remove WARN_ON_ONCE(!func)
in klp_ftrace_handler(). But this is not related. If this was
the last entry in the list, we removed the ftrace_handler
before removing the last entry. And unregister_ftrace_function()
calls rcu_synchronize() to prevent calling the handler later.

I would call rcu_synchronize() here to make sure that
klp_update_patch_state() calls will not set
an outdated task->patch_state.

Note that smp_wmb() is not enough. We do not check TIF_PATCH_PENDING
in klp_try_switch_task(). There is a tiny race:

CPU1					CPU2

klp_update_patch_state()

	if (test_and clear(task, TIF)
	     READ_ONCE(klp_target_state);

					mutex_lock(klp_lock);

					klp_reverse_transition()
					  klp_target_state =
					      !klp_target_state;

					  klp_start_transition()

					mutex_unlock(klp_lock);

					 <switch to another process>

					 klp_transition_work_fn()
					   mutex_lock(klp_lock);
					   klp_try_complete_transition()
					     klp_try_switch_task()
					       if (task->patch_state ==
						   klp_target_state)
						  return true;

	    task->patch_state = <outdated_value>;

	 klp_ftrace_handler()

BANG: klp_ftrace_handler() will use wrong implementation according
      to the outdated task->patch_state. At the same time,
      klp_transition() is not blocked by the task because it thinks
      that it has a correct state.

I am scared to have this in the sample module. It makes sense
to use the consistency model even for immediate patches because
it allows to remove them. But this must not be used for patches
that really require the consistency model. We should add
a big fat warning at least.

I like the patch. All the problems that I found look solvable.
I think that we are on the right way.
