Well, this is the standard write memory + trigger DMA case, the one
specific case for which Linus was adamant we don't need another barrier
 back then ...

Which means writel_relaxed is now pointless ?

We need clear semantics here. In this case the "side of caution" means
we are randomly doing things not understanding what really happens and
that makes me *more* nervous.

We need to know for certain anyway. Otherwise, all the drivers that do
not have wmb's are potentially broken.

So I dont agree with the status quo.

We need to establish precisely what x86 does, decide what we want the
semantic of writel to be, and implement things accordingly.
