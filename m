I think I can up with a proper way of handling that by checking
the actual amount of physical memory present instead of the hard coded
32-bit.

No, it hasn't.  That's why we have this pattern of trying a 64-bit
mask first and then setting a 32-bit mask if that fails all over
drivers/.  However with all the work we've done over the last month
we are getting really close to a world where:

 - the driver just does one dma_set_mask for the capabilities and
   stores that in the dma_mask
 - other limitations go elsewhere and will be automatically taken
   into account.

Which is I guess what you always wanted, but which wasn't how things
actually worked before.

As said, we'll get there (but with the new separate bus_dma_mask in 4.19),
but this is not how things currently work.

That is a bit of a powerpc special case (we also had one other arch
doing that, but it got removed in the great purge, can't rember which
one right now).  Everyone else has one set of ops, and they just switch
to the direct mapping inside the iommu ops.
