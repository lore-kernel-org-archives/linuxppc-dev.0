Unfortunately talitos_edesc structure size is most of the times
variable. Its exact size can only be established at "request time", and
not at "tfm init time".

Fixed size would be sizeof(talitos_edesc).
Below are factors that influence the variable part, i.e. link_tbl in
talitos_edesc:
- whether any assoc / src / dst data is scattered
- icv_stashing (case when ICV checking is done in SW)

Still we'd be better with:
-crypto API allocates request + request context (i.e.
sizeof(talitos_edesc) + any alignment required)
-talitos driver allocates variable part of talitos_edesc (if needed)

instead of:
-crypto API allocates request
-talitos driver allocates talitos_edesc (fixed + variable)
-memcopy of the req.base (crypto_async_request) into talitos_edesc

both in terms of performance and readability.

At first look, the driver wouldn't change that much:
-talitos_cra_init() callback would have to set tfm.reqsize to
sizeof(talitos_edesc) + padding and also add the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_DMA
indication in tfm.crt_flags
-talitos_edesc_alloc() logic would be pretty much the same, but would
allocate memory only for the link_tbl

I'm willing to do these changes if needed.

Right. And this flag would apply only to request __ctx[].

Herbert, would this be an acceptable addition to crypto API?

Thanks,
