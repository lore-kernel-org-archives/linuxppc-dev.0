Usually, WC memory is used with memcpy_toio() though, which
by definition doesn't have any barriers between accesses, and
is required to get the correct byte ordering on writes to memory buffers.

Sorry, I meant writel_relaxed(), not writel()

I was always puzzled by this: The intention of _relaxed() on ARM
(where it originates) was to skip the barrier that serializes DMA
with MMIO, not to skip the serialization between MMIO and locks.

I never fully understood the part about the locks, but from what
I remember, ARM is still serialized without the barrier here, but
dropping the barrier on powerpc writel_relaxed() would not
serialize against locks or DMA.
