No, not seeing any obvious relation.

But even though you listed e8099177 as a culprit you didn't list it as a
commit you reverted.  Did you leave e8099177 simply because attempting
to revert it fails (if you don't first revert other dm-mpath.c commits)?

(btw, Bart Van Assche also has issues with commit e8099177 due to hangs
during cable pull testing of mpath devices -- Bart: curious to know if
your cable pull tests pass if you just revert bcccff93).
