We only support merging on REQ_TYPE_FS already, so how is the above 
making it any different? In general, NOMERGE being set or not should not 
make a difference. It's only a hint that we need not check further if we 
should be merging on this request, since we already tried it once, found 
we'd exceed various limits, then set NOMERGE to reflect that.
