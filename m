The big comment about how bad cache invalidation failures are is on
the second, post-io invocation of the page cache flush. That's the
failure that exposes the data coherency problem to userspace:

        /*
         * Try again to invalidate clean pages which might have been cached by
         * non-direct readahead, or faulted in by get_user_pages() if the source
         * of the write was an mmap'ed region of the file we're writing.  Either
         * one is a pretty crazy thing to do, so we don't support it 100%.  If
         * this invalidation fails, tough, the write still worked...
         */
        if (iov_iter_rw(iter) == WRITE) {
                int err = invalidate_inode_pages2_range(mapping,
                                start >> PAGE_SHIFT, end >> PAGE_SHIFT);
                WARN_ON_ONCE(err);
        }

IOWs, the first warning is a "bad things might be about to
happen" warning, the second is "bad things have happened".

Again, it has nothing to do with "discouraging users" and everything
about post-bug report problem triage.

Yes, the first invalidation should also have a comment like the post
IO invalidation - the comment probably got dropped and not noticed
when the changeover from internal XFS code to generic iomap code was
made...

Cheers,

Dave.
