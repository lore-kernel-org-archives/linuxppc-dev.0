I realize that having the same file hash for both the appended
signature and extended attribute would make things a lot easier, but
security.ima is a signature of the file as written to disk, meaning it
would include any appended signature

I would prefer if you did not combine the "collect" and "appraise"
functions, but left them independent of each other.
