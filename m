It was just a bugfix, and a (partial) revert.

471d7ff8b51b says it removed ISA 2.00 support (original power4, "GP").
Support for ISA 2.01 was retained it says.  That is power4+, "GQ", but
also 970 (Apple G5).  That patch actually switched to ISA 2.02 though,
unintendedly, and code generated for ISA 2.02 will not run on systems
like 970, in principle.  It is just one uncommon instruction that is
problematical, namely popcntb, because the kernel does not use floating
point at all, so that is why we got away with it for so long (most code
that does use fp will fall flat on its face in no time).  It still is a
bug fix though!

PA6T is ISA 2.04, it's not clear how this (bugfix, and revert!) change
made code not run on PA6T anymore.  Smells a lot like something indirect
(or triply indirect), a separate bug, something that was introduced in
the last two years maybe, but I'll even bet it is something *exposed* in
that time, a bug that has been here for longer!
