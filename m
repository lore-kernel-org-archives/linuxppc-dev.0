For talitos, there are two cases:

1. request data size is <= data unit / sector size
talitos can handle any IV / tweak scheme

2. request data size > sector size
since talitos internally generates the IV for the next sector by
incrementing the previous IV, only IV schemes that allocate consecutive
IV to consecutive sectors will function correctly.

Let's not forget what XTS standard says about IVs / tweak values:
- each data unit (sector in this case) is assigned a non-negative tweak
value and
- tweak values are assigned *consecutively*, starting from an arbitrary
non-negative value
- there's no requirement for tweak values to be unpredictable

Thus, in theory ESSIV is not supposed to be used with XTS mode: the IVs
for consecutive sectors are not consecutive values.
In practice, as Milan said, the combination is sometimes used. It
functions correctly in SW (and also in talitos as long as req. data size
<= sector size).

Right, as explained above talitos does what the XTS mode standard
mandates. So it won't work properly in case of cbc-aes:essiv with
request sizes larger than sector size.

Still, in SW at least, XTS could be improved to process more sectors in
one shot, regardless of the IV scheme used - as long as there's a
IV.next() function and both data size and sector size are known.
