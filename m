Not exactly. powerpc has ZONE_DMA covering all of system memory.

What happens in ppc32 is that we somewhat "know" that none of the
systems with those stupid 31-bit limited pieces of HW is capable of
having more than 2GB of memory anyway.

So we get away with just returning "1".

Hrm... that's the usual confusion dma_capable() vs. dma_set_mask().

It's always been perfectly fine for a driver to do a dma_set_mask(64-
bit) on a system where the bridge can only do 32-bits ...

We shouldn't fail there, we should instead "clamp" the mask to 32-bit,
see what I mean ? It doesn't matter that the device itself is capable
of issuing >32 addresses, I agree, but what we need to express is that
the combination device+bridge doesn't want addresses above 32-bit, so
it's equivalent to making the device do a set_mask(32-bit).

This will succeed if the system can limit the addresses (for example
because memory is never above 32-bit) and will fail if the system
can't.

So that's equivalent of writing

	if (dev->dma_32bit_limit && mask > phys_to_dma(dev, DMA_BIT_MASK(32)))
		mask = phys_to_dma(dev, DMA_BIT_MASK(32)); 

Effectively meaning "don't give me addresses aboe 32-bit".

Still, your code doesn't check the mask against the memory size. Which
means it will fail for 32-bit masks even on systems that do not have
memory above 4G.

Well, iommus can have bypass regions, which we also use for
performance, so we do at dma_set_mask() time "swap" the ops around, and
in that case, we do want to check the mask against the actual top of
memory...
