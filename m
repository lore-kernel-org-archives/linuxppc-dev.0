[Marri]That is how I started changing the code. And I see tons of warnings
Saying "Used but not defined" or "Defined but not used". How should I
suppress
Some functions from adma.c are used in ppc440spe-adma.c and some from
ppc440spe-adma.c
Are used in adma.c. So I created intermediate file ppc440spe-adma.h with
inlined
Functions. In future this will be converted into ppc4xx_adma.h and move
existing
SoC specific stuff to ppc440spe-adma.c file.

As I responded to Mr. Wolfgang in previous email, similar SoC DMA engines
will
Be resolved at run time. Whereas completely different architectures will
be
Resolved at build time.
