Honestly, I think those are the sane semantics. In fact, make it
"ordered with previous writes" full stop, since it's not only ordered
wrt previous writes to memory, but also previous writel's.

If that KICK_ON_READ is UC, then that's definitely the case. And
honestly, status registers like that really should always be UC.

But if somebody sets the area WC (which is crazy), then I think it
might be at least debatable. x86 semantics does allow reads to be done
before previous writes (or, put another way, writes to be buffered -
the buffers are ordered so writes don't get re-ordered, but reads can
happen during the buffering).

But UC accesses are always  done entirely ordered, and honestly, any
status register that starts a DMA would not make sense any other way.

Of course, you'd have to be pretty odd to want to start a DMA with a
read anyway - partly exactly because it's bad for performance since
reads will be synchronous and not buffered like a write).
