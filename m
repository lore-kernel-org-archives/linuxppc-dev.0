x86's ELF_ET_DYN_BASE is (TASK_SIZE / 3 * 2), so it puts it ET_DYN
base at the top third of the address space. (In theory, this is to
avoid interpreter collisions, but I'm working on removing that
restriction, as it seems pointless.)

Other architectures have small ELF_ET_DYN_BASEs, which is good: it
allows them to have larger entropy for ET_DYN.
