Many of the drivers in drivers/infiniband work with write combining
memory.

The usual pattern is a desire to push 32 or 64 bytes to the WC BAR as
efficiently as possible, ideally in a single PCI-E TLP.

A memcpy_to_wc primitive could probably cover these use cases, no need
to redesign the IO accessors..

The WC memory is never read, so read/write order is not important to
any infiniband driver.

What is very important is keeping the WC behavior isolated within the
spinlock. WC to the same addresses cannot be permitted in this pattern:

   writel(addr = 0);
   mmiowmb();
   spin_unlock();
   spin_lock()
   writel(addr = 0);

The CPU must always generate two PCI-E TLPs to the device.

This is a super performance critical operation for most drivers and
directly impacts network performance.
