I think doing this separately  would be good, I don't see any interdependency
with the other patches, we just need to decide what we want in the long
run.

I agree my text that you cited doesn't capture the situation correctly,
as this is really about the obsolete system calls that take 64-bit time_t
arguments on architectures that are converted to allow 64-bit time_t
for non-obsolete system calls.

Maybe it's better to just reword this to

      "This controls the compilation of the following system calls:
      time, stime, gettimeofday, settimeofday, adjtimex, nanosleep,
alarm, getitimer,
      setitimer, select, utime, utimes, futimesat, and {old,new}{l,f,}stat{,64}.
      These are all replaced by other interfaces (e.g. posix timers and clocks,
      statx) on architectures that got converted from 32-bit time_t to
64-bit time_t.
      C libraries implementing 64-bit time_t in 32-bit architectures have to
      implement the handles by wrapping around the newer interfaces.
      New architectures should not explicitly enable this."

That would clarify that it's not about the compat system calls, while
also allowing the two options to be set independently.
