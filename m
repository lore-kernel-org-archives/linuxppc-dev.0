This is great explanation. Thanks for it.

I would prefer the -EINVAL. It might safe some hairs when anyone
is working on patching the switch_to stuff. Also it is not that
big loss beacuse most tasks will get migrated on the return to
userspace.

It might help a bit with the newly forked kthreads. But there should
be more safe location where the new kthreads might get migrated,
e.g. right before the main function gets called.

I see and am surprised that we take the lock only in core.c ;-)

I do not have a strong opinion then. Just a small one. The lock guards
also operations from the other .c files. I think that it is only a matter
of time when we will need to access it there. But the work is clearly
transition-related. But it is a real nitpicking. I am sorry for it.

Yup, sounds better.

Ah, I had in mind that it could be replaced by that

	mod_delayed_work(system_wq, &klp_transition_work, 0);

So, that we would never call klp_try_complete_transition()
directly. Then it could be the same in all situations. But
it might look strange and be ineffective when really starting
the transition. So, maybe forget about it.
