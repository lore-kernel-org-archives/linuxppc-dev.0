VAS spec says small number of retries. During my 12 hour test with 1024 threads - doing continuous compression/decompression requests, noticed around 6 or 7 retries needed. Hence used 10 retries.

One possible case. We can also see failures when receive/send credit are exhausted or reached the cached windows limit.

Hard to know the reason of failure. VAS simply returns success or failure without providing the actual reason.

Hard to decide whether to fall back on other NX engine since no way to know the actual failure reason on the current NX or no idea whether other NX is free.

842 compression/decompression request size for NX is always fixed. So divide in to smaller requests for large buffer. Whereas NX gzip engine is different - can be configurable request size. We can look at this optimization when gzip support is added.

Right now falls back to SW decompression after 10 retries. Whereas user can use SW 842 compression upon failures.

We are planning to look in to performance analysis as part of VAS/NX optimizatiion and make necessary changes.
