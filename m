FWIW, I just tried this:

static bool is_entry_text(unsigned long addr)
{
    return addr >= (unsigned long)__entry_text_start &&
        addr < (unsigned long)__entry_text_end;
}

it works.  So the entry code is already annotated reasonably well :)

I just hacked it up here:

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/luto/linux.git/commit/?h=stack&id=085eacfe0edfc18768e48340084415dba9a6bd21

and it seems to work, at least for page faults.  A better
implementation would print out the entire contents of pt_regs so that
people reading the stack trace will know the registers at the time of
the exception, which might be helpful.

It doesn't make the unwinder faster -- it makes the entry code faster.

True.  And it'll automatically follow pt_regs.

Hmm, interesting.

I hope your plans include rewriting the current stack unwinder
completely.  The thing in print_context_stack is (a)
hard-to-understand and hard-to-modify crap and (b) is called in a loop
from another file using totally ridiculous conventions.
