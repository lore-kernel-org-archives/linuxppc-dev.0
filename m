I think we should do that.  The silly sample patch I sent you (or at
least that I think I sent you) did that, and it worked nicely.

I don't love this part.  It's going to hurt performance, and, given
that we need to change the unwinder anyway to make it useful, let's
just emit a table somewhere in .rodata and use it directly.

This one is particular is quite hot, so I'd much rather avoid it.
