You're correct.

Qemu is started with:

    -numa node,cpus=0-1 -numa node,cpus=2-3 \
    -smp 2,maxcpus=4,cores=4,threads=1,sockets=1

Which means we have 2 nodes with cpu ids 0 and 1 on node 0, and cpu ids
2 and 3 on node 1, but at boot only 2 CPUs are present.

The problem I try to fix with this series is when we hotplug a third
CPU, to node 1 with id 2.

Thanks,
Laurent
