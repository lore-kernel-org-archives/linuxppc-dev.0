Hey Oren, thanks for taking a look.

No, but I'll add one if it looks too hard to fix for the next round.

Yeah, I considered that discussion, but the situation is different for
powerpc (someone on linuxppc-dev smack me if I'm wrong here :)
pt_regs is part of the ABI, and it encompasses all user mode registers
except for floating point, which are handled separately.

Yeah, I'll have to fix these up.

Alright.  By the way, why are cr_hdr->type and cr_hdr->len signed
types?

It can differ depending on kernel configuration.

Explain why, please?  This isn't a lot of code, and it seems likely
that checkpoint and restart paths will share data structures and tend
to be modified together over time.

It seems to me that defining your own pr_fmt in a "public" header like
that is inappropriate, or at least unconventional.  Any file that
happens to include linux/checkpoint.h will have any prior definitions
of pr_fmt overridden, no?

I had this in mind with the treatment of MSR, but I'll check on the
others, thanks.

It returns whatever error value cr_read_obj_type() returns.  Hrm.  I
guess if the image is garbage, cr_read_obj_type can potentially return
a non-error value that still isn't the desired value, is that right?
