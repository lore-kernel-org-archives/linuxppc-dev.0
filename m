Brian, maybe we should just bite that bullet and implement that hybrid
DMA ops I mentioned. I'll see if I can spare some time today to look
at it. It would work as long as we never remove the legacy window using
the DDW APIs (removing the legacy window is broken anyway for other
reasons I think we discussed already).

As long as we have both the legacy window and the DDW available (or the
legacy and bypass on "nv"), we can then route individual DMAs according
to the corresponding applicable mask.

I'll try to come up with a patch but I'll need you to test it.

Cheers,
Ben.
