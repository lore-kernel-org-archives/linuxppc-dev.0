To elaborate, if you do the following on arm:

	writel(DEVICE_FOO);
	writel(DEVICE_BAR);

we generally cannot guarantee in which order those accesses will hit the
devices even if we add every barrier under the sun. You'd need something
in between, specific to DEVICE_FOO (probably a read-back) to really push
the first write out. This doesn't sound like it would be that uncommon to
me.

On the other hand:

	writel(DEVICE_FOO);
	writel(DEVICE_FOO);

is obviously ordered and also things like:

	writel(DEVICE_FOO_IN_PCI_MEM_SPACE);
	writel(DEVICE_BAR_IN_SAME_PCI_MEM_SPACE);

are ordered up to the PCI host bridge, because that's really the "device"
here.
