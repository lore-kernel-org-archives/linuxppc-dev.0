Not even all of x86, but AMD in particular, Intel does it yet another
way.  But it still is easier to take this into the core with a few
overrides than duplicating all the code.

ZONE_DMA usually (but not always) maps to 24-bits of address space,
if it doesn't (I mostly through about s390 with it's odd 31-bits)
the architecture can override it if it cares).

This is really weird.  Why would you wire up ZONE_DMA like this?
The general scheme that architectures should implement is:

ZONE_DMA:	Any memory below a magic threshold that is lower than
		32-bit.  Only enabled if actually required (usually
		either 24-bit for ISA, or some other weird architecture
		specific value like 32-bit for S/390)
ZONE_DMA32:	Memory <= 32-bit if the architecture supports more than
		32-bits worth of physical address space.  Should generally
		be enabled on all 64-bit architectures unless you have
		a very good reason not to.
ZONE_NORMAL:	Everything above 32-bit not falling into HIGHMEM or
		MOVEABLE.
