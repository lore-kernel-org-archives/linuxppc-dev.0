That's correct. We can go upto 28-bits of entropy for 64BIT platforms
using 64K pages with the current approach. I see arm64 using > 28 bits
of entropy randomness in some cases, but I think 28-bit MAX entropy is
sensible for 64BIT/64K combination on PPC.

It basically affects all shared object files (as noted in [1]).
However as Kees noted in one of his reviews, I think this 2nd patch
might not be needed for all generic ppc platforms.
