In the case of restarting a container, I think it's ok if a restarting
tasks dies in an "ugly" way -- this will be observed and handled by the
initiating task outside the container, which will gracefully report to
the caller/user.

Even if you close this hole, then any other failure later on during
restart - even a failure to allocate kernel memory due to memory pressure,
will give that undesired effect that you are trying to avoid.

That said, any difference in the architecture that may cause restart to
fail is probably best placed in cr_write_head_arch.

More specifically, I envision restart to work like this:

1) user invokes user-land utility (e.g. "cr --restart ..."
2) 'cr' will create a new container
3) 'cr' will start a child in that container
4) child will create rest of tree (in kernel or in user space - tbd)
5) each task in that tree will restore itself
6) 'cr' monitors this process
7) if all goes well - 'cr' report ok.
8) if something goes bad, 'cr' notices and notifies caller/user

so tasks that are restarting may just as well die badly - we don't care.

Does that make sense ?

Oren.
