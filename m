Where is the bug report from the person who set CONFIG_BROKEN=y in the 
collie defconfig that the BROKEN dependency on MTD_SHARP was wrong?

The whining is the bug report the person who set the CONFIG_BROKEN=y in 
the defconfig didn't send.

And things would have been even worse if I had sent a patch erasing 
MTD_SHARP from the kernel because code "both marked as obsolete and 
BROKEN can clearly be removed" and the code was therefore completely 
removed two months before the first person whined?

The point is that I haven't yet heard any good reason for 
CONFIG_BROKEN=y in a defconfig.

No, it's not a good reason if someone used it as a workaround instead of 
sending a bug report that would result in a fixing of the wrong BROKEN 
dependency.

Where is the bug report of the person setting CONFIG_BROKEN=y in the 
collie defconfig that the MTD_SHARP dependency on BROKEN was wrong?
