o lord, save us, no.

Me either.

yup.

In this case we could just require that each jprobes-supporting
architecture implement arch_deref_entry_point().


Or one could do the Linus trick.  In each architecture which implements
arch_deref_entry_point() do:

#define arch_deref_entry_point arch_deref_entry_point

in the per-arch header file then, in non-arch code, do

#ifndef arch_deref_entry_point
static unsigned long arch_deref_entry_point(...)
{
	<generic implementation>
}
#endif

That's just the ARCH_HAS_FOO_BAR thing, only less fugly.
