You're right, I used the word "sleeping" when I meant "not currently
executing on a CPU".  (Peter Z also pointed that out.)

Most of the new livepatch code is arch-independent, but the consistency
model part of it (i.e., !klp_patch.immediate) is currently only
supported by x86_64.

For adding support for other architectures, there are a few options:

1) Add CONFIG_HAVE_RELIABLE_STACKTRACE.  This means porting objtool, and
   for non-DWARF unwinders, also making sure there's a way for the stack
   tracing code to detect interrupts on the stack.

2) Alternatively, figure out a way to patch kthreads without stack
   checking.  If all kthreads sleep in the same place, then we can
   designate that place as a patching point.  I think Petr M has been
   working on that?  In that case, arches without
   HAVE_RELIABLE_STACKTRACE would still be able to use the
   non-stack-checking parts of the consistency model:

   a) patching user tasks when they cross the kernel/user space
      boundary; and

   b) patching kthreads and idle tasks at their designated patch points.

   This option isn't as good as option 1 because it requires signaling
   most of the tasks to patch them.  But it could still be a good backup
   option for those architectures which don't have reliable stack traces
   yet.

In the meantime, other architectures can keep today's behavior by
setting klp_patch.immediate to true.
