I think I forgot that during appraisal the modsig is copied into the
iint cache and that it will be used when the measure rule is trigerred.
I'll drop that last paragraph.

Ok. I didn't create a function because these tests are only done here,
but I agree that it will make the code clearer, and be a better place
for the big comment as well. Will do in the next version.
