Ok, good.

An MSR read is about 1500 clock cycles, but it need not be the fast path
(e.g. use a bit to check if the CPU is running, if not use the MSR to
check if the CPU is in userspace but the CPU thread is scheduled).  But
it's not necessary if you are just matching PPC semantics.

Then the simplest thing is to use the kvm_steal_time struct, and add a
new field to it that replaces pad[0].  You can write a 0 to the flag in
record_steal_time (not preempted) and a 1 in kvm_arch_vcpu_put
(preempted).  record_steal_time is called before the VM starts running,
immediately after KVM_RUN and also after every sched_in.

If KVM doesn't implement the flag, it won't touch that field at all.  So
the kernel can write a 0, meaning "not preempted", and not care if the
hypervisor implements the flag or not: the answer will always be safe.

The pointer to the flag can be placed in a per-cpu u32*, and again if
the u32* is NULL that means "not preempted".
