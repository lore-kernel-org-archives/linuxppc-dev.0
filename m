OK thanks.

linux-arch is still fairly high traffic, so it's no guarantee arch maintainers
will see it, but it's probably worth a try.

Yeah. I think we'll probably enable it gradually as folks get time to test it.
ie. ppc64le first, then ppc64 (BE), and then 32-bit if someone is interested.

cheers
