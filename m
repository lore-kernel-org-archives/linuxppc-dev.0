Yeah, the other platforms that support these devices support ZONE_DMA
to reliably handle these devices. But there is two other ways the
current code would actually handle these fine despite the dma_direct
checks:

 1) if the device only has physical addresses up to 31-bit anyway
 2) by trying again to find a lower address.  But this only works
    for coherent allocations and not streaming maps (unless we have
    swiotlb with a buffer below 31-bits).

It seems powerpc can have ZONE_DMA, though and we will cover these
devices just fine.  If it didn't have that the current powerpc
code would not work either.

If your PCI bridge / PCIe root port doesn't support dma to addresses
larger than 32-bit the device capabilities above that don't matter, it
just won't work.  We have this case at least for some old VIA x86 chipsets
and some relatively modern Xilinx FPGAs with PCIe.

Your are not missing anything except for the history of this code.

Your observation is right, but there always has been the implicit
assumption that architectures with more than 4GB of physical address
space must either support and iommu or swiotlb and use that.  It's
never been document anywhere, but I'm working on integrating all
this code to make more sense.
