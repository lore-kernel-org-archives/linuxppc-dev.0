(Assume you meant "included in checkpoint-unrelated code")

I could see checkpoint.h being included by files that don't
exclusively deal with C/R.  If you want a uniform debug statement
format for C/R-related code, that's fine, but this isn't the way to do
it.  See the existing users (almost all in drivers/s390).
