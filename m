Yes, and we've already discussed it with Josh. The plan is not to do 
anything now, because described situations should be rare and/or 
theoretical only. It should be on our TODO lists though.

I would not bother about it.

I agree. I think the best would be to move klp_try_complete_transition() 
out from klp_start_transition() and call it explicitly. This would solve 
the immediate problem for free.

I agree we should not call klp_try_complete_transition() from 
klp_reverse_transition() and leave it entirely to our delayed work. We 
discussed this in the past and the counter argument was that explicit call 
to klp_try_complete_transition() could make the process a bit faster. 
Possibly true, but reversion is really slow path and I would not care 
about speed at all. I think it is cleaner and perhaps safer.

Thanks,
Miroslav
