Nice work!

AFAICT this should work for every arch, as long as they start with _text
(esp: data and init must be > _text).  In addition, it's not harmful on
32 bit archs.

IOW, I'd like to turn it on for everyone and discard some code.  But
it's easier to roll in like you've done first.

Should we enable it by default for every arch for now, and see what
happens?

Thanks!
Rusty.
