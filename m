Most 32 bit systems don't have atomic 64bit writes.
I'd also have thought there would be code which wouldn't mind the
write being done as two cycles.

I'm not sure that some of the ppc soc systems are capable of
doing a 64bit data pci/pcie cycle except by dma.
So your driver is probably doomed to require a lock.
