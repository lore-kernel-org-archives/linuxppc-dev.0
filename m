I am in doubts here. We copy the state from the parent here. It means
that the new process might still need to be converted. But at the same
point print_context_stack_reliable() returns zero without printing
any stack trace when TIF_FORK flag is set. It means that a freshly
forked task might get be converted immediately. I seems that boot
operations are always done when copy_process() is called. But
they are contradicting each other.

I guess that print_context_stack_reliable() should either return
-EINVAL when TIF_FORK is set. Or it should try to print the
stack of the newly forked task.

Or do I miss something, please?

It is a bit strange that we keep the work scheduled. It might be
better to use

       mod_delayed_work(system_wq, &klp_work, 0);

Which triggers more ideas from the nitpicking deparment:

I would move the work definition from core.c to transition.c because
it is closely related to klp_try_complete_transition();

When on it. I would make it more clear that the work is related
to transition. Also I would call queue_delayed_work() directly
instead of adding the klp_schedule_work() wrapper. The delay
might be defined using a constant, e.g.

#define KLP_TRANSITION_DELAY round_jiffies_relative(HZ)

queue_delayed_work(system_wq, &klp_transition_work, KLP_TRANSITION_DELAY);

Finally, the following is always called right after
klp_start_transition(), so I would call it from there.

	if (!klp_try_complete_transition())
		klp_schedule_work();

It is really great work! I am checking this patch from left, right, top,
and even bottom and all seems to work well together.
