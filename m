Yes, it's fine for fsl-dma itself, but it cannot work under complex conditi=
on.
For example, we enable NET_DMA and SEC xor offload, if NAPI task is waken u=
p to
synchronize pending requests when raid5 dma copy was submitted, the process=
 order
of raid5 tx descriptor is not as our expected. Unfortunately, sometime we h=
ave
to check this dependent tx descriptor which has was already released.

Hi ira, this issue should be not related to dma status. The last descriptor
is left as usb null descriptor, actually, this descriptor is used as usb nu=
ll
descriptor, at any case, I believe it has been already completed, but I
will released it in next chain, it doesn't affect the upper api to use the
data, and make sure async_tx api won't raise an exception=20
(BUG_ON(async_tx_test_ack(depend_tx)), this depend_tx is the desc->async_tx=
).

The error still happened. spin_lock_bh() and spin_unlock_bh() are modified
after this patch.

It won't be happened if use fsl-dma, because the right order is=20
xor-copy-xor->callback, The callback which you concerned is implemented=20
in talitos driver, callback should be null in fsl-dma.
