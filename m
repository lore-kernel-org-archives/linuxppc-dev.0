... and there is quite some.

stuff like make_readable_exclusive_migration_entry_from_page() must be
reworked.

Maybe after some reworks it will no longer look like a hack.

Right now it does.

Yes. I provided ideas on how to minimize the impact.

Again, maybe if done right it will be okay-ish.

It will likely still be error prone, but I have no idea how on earth we
could possible catch reliably for an "unsigned long" pfn whether it is a
PFN (it's right there in the name ...) or something completely different.

We don't want another pfn_t, it would be too much churn to convert most
of MM.

Well, so far a PFN is a PFN, and when you actually have a *page* (after
pfn_to_page() etc) you can just test for these cases.

The page is actually sufficient to make a decision.

With a PFN you have to carry auxiliary information.

Again, maybe it can be done in a better way. I did not enjoy some of the
code changes I was reading.

I meant in stuff like page_vma_mapped. Probably not the hottest path,
and maybe the impact can be reduced by reworking it.
