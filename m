Ok so this is our answer ...

Good.

So the overlap may not be that NIL in practice :-) But even then that
doesn't matter as ARM has been happily implementing the same semantic
you describe above for years, as do we powerpc.

This is why, I want (with your agreement) to define clearly and once
and for all, that the Linux semantics of writel are that it is ordered
with previous writes to coherent memory (*)

This is already what ARM and powerpc provide, from what you say, what
x86 provides, I don't see any reason to keep that badly documented and
have drivers randomly growing useless wmb()'s because they don't think
it works on x86 without them !

Once that's sorted, let's tackle the problem of mmiowb vs. spin_unlock
and the problem of writel_relaxed semantics but as separate issues :-)

Also, can I assume the above ordering with writel() equally applies to
readl() or not ?

IE:
	dma_buf->foo = 1;
	readl(STUPID_DEVICE_DMA_KICK_ON_READ);

Also works on x86 ? (It does on power, maybe not on ARM).

Cheers,
Ben.

(*) From an Linux API perspective, all of this is only valid if the
memory was allocated by dma_alloc_coherent(). Anything obtained by
dma_map_something() might have been bounced bufferred or might require
extra cache flushes on some architectures, and thus needs
dma_sync_for_{cpu,device} calls.

Cheers,
Ben.
