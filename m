Some more ideas from the world of crazy races. I was shaking my head
if this was safe or not.

The problem might be if the task get rescheduled between the check
for the pending stuff or inside the klp_patch_task() function.
This will get even more important when we use this construct
on some more locations, e.g. in some kthreads.

If the task is sleeping on this strange locations, it might assign
strange values on strange times.

I think that it is safe only because it is called with the
'current' parameter and on a safe locations. It means that
the result is always safe and consistent. Also we could assign
an outdated value only when sleeping between reading klp_target_state
and storing task->patch_state. But if anyone modified
klp_target_state at this point, he also set TIF_PENDING_PATCH,
so the change will not get lost.

I think that we should document that klp_patch_func() must be
called only from a safe location from within the affected task.

I even suggest to avoid misuse by removing the struct *task_struct
parameter. It should always be called with current.

Petr
