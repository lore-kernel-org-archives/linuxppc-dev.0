(oops, missed a "universe" -> "patch state" rename)

Yeah, I would agree with that.  And also, it's probably a red flag that
the barrier needs *three* paragraphs to describe the various cases its
needed for.

However, there are some complications:

1) The stores are in separate functions (which is a generally a good
   thing as it greatly helps the readability of the code).

2) Which stores are being ordered depends on whether the function is
   called in the enable path or the disable path.

3) Either way it actually orders *two* separate pairs of stores.

Anyway I'm thinking I should move that barrier out of
klp_init_transition() and into its callers.  The stores will still be in
separate functions but at least there will be better visibility of where
the stores are occurring, and the comments can be a little more focused.
