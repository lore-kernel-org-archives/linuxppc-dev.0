I think this isn't a possibility.

In today's code base, this can't happen because task patch states are
only switched when sleeping or when exiting the kernel.  The ftrace
handler doesn't sleep directly.

If it were preempted, it couldn't be switched there either because we
consider preempted stacks to be unreliable.

In theory, a DWARF stack trace of a preempted task *could* be reliable.
But then the DWARF unwinder should be smart enough to see that the
original function called the ftrace handler.  Right?  So the stack would
be reliable, but then livepatch would see the original function on the
stack and wouldn't switch the task.

Does that make sense?
