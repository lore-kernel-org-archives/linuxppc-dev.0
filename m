Oh, for sure, the generic fix would be the longer-term goal, this was 
just an expedient compromise because I want to get *something* landed 
for 4.19. Since in practice this is predominantly affecting arm64, doing 
the arch-specific fix to appease affected customers then working to 
generalise it afterwards seemed to carry the lowest risk.

That said, I think I can see a relatively safe and clean alternative 
approach based on converting dma_32bit_limit to a mask, so I'll spin 
some patches around that idea ASAP to continue the discussion.

It's entirely possible to plug an old PCI soundcard via a bridge adapter 
into a modern board where the card's 24-bit DMA mask reaches nothing but 
the SoC's boot flash, and no IOMMU is available (e.g. some of the 
smaller NXP Layercape stuff); I still think there should be an error in 
such rare cases when DMA is utterly impossible, but otherwise I agree it 
would be much nicer for drivers to just provide their preferred mask and 
let the ops massage it as necessary.

Robin.
