If not we need to fix it. It's guaranteed on the "main" ones (arm,
arm64, powerpc, i386, x86_64). We might need to check with other arch
maintainers for the rest.

We really want Linux to provide well defined "sane" semantics for the
basic writel accessors.

Note: We still have open questions about how readl() relates to
surrounding memory accesses. It looks like ARM and powerpc do different
things here.

I would think ia64 fixed it back when it was all discussed. I was under
the impression all ia64 had "special" was the writel vs. spin_unlock
which requires mmiowb, but maybe that was never completely fixed ?

Well, it probably should then.

Well, let's fix them or leave them broken, at this point, it doesn't
matter. We can give all arch maintainers a wakeup call and start making
drivers work based on the documented assumptions.

I'm working on the problem of relaxed APIs for powerpc, but we can keep
that orthogonal. As is, today, a wmb() + writel() and a wmb() +
writel_relaxed() on powerpc are identical. So changing them will not
break us.

But I don't see the point of doing that transformation if we can just
get the straying archs fixed. It's not like any of them has a
significant market presence these days anyway.

Cheers,
Ben.
