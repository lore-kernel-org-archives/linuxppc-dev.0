I don't think that would work. The mpt2sas driver wants to set the dma mask to 64bits
but set the coherent mask to 32 bits, then my change is to set the coherent mask to
64bits if setting it to 32bit fails. I'm not seeing how using dma_set_mask_and_coherent
would simplify anything here.

Thanks,

Brian
