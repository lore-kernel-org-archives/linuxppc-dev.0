We already virtualise the CPU numbers, but not the node IDs. And it's
the node IDs that are really the problem.

So yeah I guess we might be able to make that work, but I'd have to
think about it a bit more.

We don't need it to be dynamic (at least for this bug).

Laurent is booting Qemu with a fixed CPU <-> Node mapping, it's just
that because some CPUs aren't present at boot we don't know what the
node mapping is. (Correct me if I'm wrong Laurent).

So all we need is:
 - the workqueue code to cope with CPUs that are possible but not online
   having NUMA_NO_NODE to begin with.
 - a way to update the workqueue cpumask when the CPU comes online.


Which seems reasonable to me?

cheers
