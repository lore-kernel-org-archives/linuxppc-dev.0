If removing those will lower the requirement for PPC, that would be
ideal. Otherwise, I'd like to take the practical approach of making
the plugins available on PPC right now, with an eye towards relaxing
the version requirement as people need it.

That is rather odd. What distro was the PPC test done on? (Or were
these manually built gcc versions?)
