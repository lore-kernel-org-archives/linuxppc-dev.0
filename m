Indeed.  Speaking for myself only, the whole issue has only come about
because somewhere after 2.4.20, the handling of Promise add-on IDE
controllers was changed so that where the Promise hard drives on the
Apple Xserve were previously /dev/hde to /dev/hdh and the "mainboard"
IDE (which only handles the CD-ROM) was /dev/hda to /dev/hdd, their
internal order is now reversed, and for some reason I am unable to get
the metadevice to work after the change (so am effectively unable to
update my kernel as root is on md).
