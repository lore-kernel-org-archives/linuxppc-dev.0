Huh?  Does the ppc440spe engine have some notion of flagging a source
as old_p/old_q?  Otherwise I do not see how the engine will not turn
this into:

p` = p + src4 + q
q` = q + {10}*src4 + {x}*p

I think you missed the fact that we have passed p and q back in as
sources.  Unless we have multiple p destinations and multiple q
destinations, or hardware support for continuations I do not see how
you can guarantee this split.

Data corruption is a slightly higher cost :-).

Yes it does, but the engine does not know it is a destination.

Take a look at page 496 of the following and tell me if you come to a
different conclusion.
