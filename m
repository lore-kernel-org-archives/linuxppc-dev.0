Well, we need to clarify that once and for all, because as I wrote
earlier, it was decreed by Linus more than a decade ago that writel
would be fully ordered by itself vs. previous memory stores (at least
on UC memory).

This is why we added sync's to writel on powerpc and later ARM added
similar barriers to theirs.

This is also why writel_relaxed was added (though much later), since
what writel_relaxed does is to life that specific requirement.

IE. If what you say is true and wmb() is needed on x86, then
writel_relaxed is now completely useless...

Ben.
