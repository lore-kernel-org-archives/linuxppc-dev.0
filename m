Just to clarify ... barrier() is just a compiler barrier, it means the
compiler will generate things in the order they are written. This isn't
sufficient on archs with an OO memory model, where an actual memory
barrier instruction needs to be emited.

Well, the documentation says we don't care about synchronization vs.
locks so we should probably remove it (then we need to make sure mmiowb
works, thus sets the flag).

Yes, as far as I know all implementations will stop combining on *any*
barrier instruction.

I don't know whether any does it, but I want to provide a way for a
driver to somewhat reliably obtain write combine semantics without
having to hand code endian swap and other horrors involved with using
__raw_* accessors.

So my thinking is to define that the combination of WC + writel_relaxed
gives you that, which it does at least on x86 and ARM afaik.

Cheers,
Ben.
