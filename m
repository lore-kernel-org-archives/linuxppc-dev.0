We have a few problems that currently prevent us from using shared
drivers across arm32 and arm64:

- arm32 has an architecture-defined pci_sys_data structure, but
  we really want to have one that is defined by the host bridge driver
  and that is architecture independent. Some core functions depend
  on this structure at the moment, which Lorenzo is trying to
  undo

- The pci_common_init interface on arm32 doesn't work well on
  loadable drivers, it does not return an error, and it is built
  around the assumption that you probe all pci host bridges at
  the same time, while the standard Linux driver model assumes
  that you probe one at a time.

- The way we pass a temporary structure (hw_pci) with function pointers
  into the architecture code makes it relatively hard to follow
  how the initialization sequence works.

Yes, I think a simpler interface structure would be better than trying
to minimize the amount of code needed in drivers at the expense of
interface complexity.

These are completely different use cases:

a) For DT, we want loadable device drivers that start by probing a host
   bridge device which was added through the DT platform code. The
   driver is self-contained, and eventually we want to be able to unload
   it. We have lots of different per-soc drivers that require different
   quirks

b) For ACPI, the interface is defined in the ACPI spec across architectures
   and SoCs, we don't have host bridge drivers and the code that initializes
   the PCI is required early during boot and called from architecture
   code. There is no parent device, as ACPI sees PCI as a fundamental building
   block by itself, and there are no drivers because the firmware does
   the initial hardware setup, so we only have to access the config space.
