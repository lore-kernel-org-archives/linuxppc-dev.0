Cool!

We can refer to new symbols from there, we just have a script to check
we don't refer to anything new inadvertently.

prom_init() is sort of a shim that runs before the kernel, except it's
linked with the kernel, but ideally wouldn't be, but we never bothered
actually making it separate. O_o

OK, yeah it's using asm labels to compare the patched code vs the
expected result. Can probably be fixed by making them char[] like we do
for other things like __start_interrupts etc.

cheers
