Thanks for the patch. I have a couple of comments:

(A) As Aneesh noted in the review of my v2 patch (see [1]), we need to
handle the configurable 512TB case as well. Right?

(b) I am wondering if I missed your comments on my v2 on the same
subject - may be you missed my reminder message (see [2]).

I am just starting off on PPC related enhancements that we find useful
while working on Redhat/Fedora PPC systems (I have mainly been
associated with ARM and peripheral driver development in the past),
and would have been motivated further if I could get responses to my
queries which I had raised earlier on the list (see [3]) - especially
the branch to base newer version of patches on.

Also I am not sure how the PPC subsystem handles S-O-Bs of earlier
contributions on the same subject (as it varies from one
maintainer/subsystem to the other), so I leave it up to you.

That being said, I will try to improve any new patches I plan to send
out on PPC mailing list in future.
