All true indeed, though a lot of other archs never quite made them
fully synchronous, which was another can of worms ... oh well.

As for Adaptec, you might be right, I do remember having cases of old
stuff triggering DMA on reads, it might have been "Mac" variants of
Adaptec using MMIO or something...
