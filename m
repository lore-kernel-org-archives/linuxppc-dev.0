Hmm.

What actually happens when you unwind all the way into the entry code?
 Don't you end up in something that isn't in an ELF function?  Can you
detect that?  Ideally, the unwinder could actually detect that it's
hit a pt_regs struct and report that.  If used for stack dumps, it
could display some indication of this and then continue its unwinding
by decoding the pt_regs.  If used for patching, it could take some
other appropriate action.

I would have no objection to annotating all the pt_regs-style entry
code, whether by putting it in a separate section or by making a table
of addresses.

There are a couple of nasty cases if NMI or MCE is involved but, as of
4.6, outside of NMI, MCE, and vmalloc faults (ugh!), there should
always be a complete pt_regs on the stack before interrupts get
enabled for each entry.  Of course, finding the thing may be
nontrivial in case other things were pushed.  I suppose we could try
to rejigger the code so that rbp points to pt_regs or similar.
