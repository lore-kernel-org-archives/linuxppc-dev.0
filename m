As you say, this only works if every symbol >= _text, which is
obviously not the case per the conditional in scripts/kallsyms.c,
which emits _text + n or _text - n depending on whether the symbol
precedes or follows _text. The git log tells me for which arch this
was originally implemented, but it does not tell me which other archs
have come to rely on it in the meantime.

On top of that, ia64 fails to build with this option, since it has
some whitelisted absolute symbols that look suspiciously like they
could be emitted as _text relative (and it does not even matter in the
absence of CONFIG_RELOCATABLE on ia64, afaict) but I don't know
whether we can just override their types as T, since it would also
change the type in the contents of /proc/kallsyms. So some guidance
would be appreciated here.

So I agree that it would be preferred to have a single code path, but
I would need some help validating it on architectures I don't have
access to.

Thanks,
Ard.
